The first concerns musical emotion, where we examine musical expectations as a potential mechanism for emotion induction.  Ratings of expectancy and emotion (arousal/valence) were collected for 32 pieces of music with either predictable pitch and onset, unpredictable pitch and onset, or both combinations of the two.  Using cross-sectional time-series analysis, we find that pitch and onset predictability, as measured by IDyOM, successfully predicts all types of ratings. The second project concerns relative salience in polyphonic music, where two studies test the hypothesis that salience is proportional to information content.  By collecting complexity ratings on the same stimuli used in a same-different discrimination task, we show that information content is proportional to subjective complexity and observe qualitative evidence that complexity is in turn proportional to salience.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">Bio</span></br>\nSarah is a PhD student in the Music Cognition Lab under the supervision of Dr. Marcus Pearce. Her research interests include expectation, attention, auditory scene analysis and the effects of musical training on perception.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Sarah Anne Sauvé - Latest data on musical emotion and relative salience in polyphonic music projects","date":"Wednesday, 31 May 2017","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2017-05-31.C4DM-Seminar_-_Sarah_Anne_Sauve_-_Latest_data_on_musical_emotion_and_relative_salience_in_polyphonic_music_projects","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2017-05-31.C4DM-Seminar_-_Sarah_Anne_Sauve_-_Latest_data_on_musical_emotion_and_relative_salience_in_polyphonic_music_projects/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2017-05-31.C4DM-Seminar_-_Sarah_Anne_Sauve_-_Latest_data_on_musical_emotion_and_relative_salience_in_polyphonic_music_projects","crumbLabel":"2017-05-31.C4DM-Seminar_-_Sarah_Anne_Sauve_-_Latest_data_on_musical_emotion_and_relative_salience_in_polyphonic_music_projects"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
