This is a particularly complex problem due to the variability in how people vocalise sounds and the acoustic diversity across sound categories. Successful approaches must bridge the gap between vocal and non-vocal audio, while handling the unpredictability of human-generated imitations.</p>\n<p>The team’s submission, titled “Effective Finetuning Methods for Query-by Vocal Imitation”, advances the state-of-the-art in QbVI by integrating a triplet-based regularisation objective with supervised contrastive learning. This method addresses the issue of limited data by sampling from an unused subset of the VocalSketch dataset, which comprises practice recordings and human-rejected vocal imitations. While this data may not be suitable for positive matches, the vocal imitation data is useful for creating confounding examples during training. More specifically, this increases the size of the pool of negative examples, which is utilised by the added regularisation method.</p>\n<p>The proposed method surpassed state-of-the-art methods for both subjective and objective evaluation metrics, opening up scope for product-based innovations and software tools that can be used by artists to effectively search large repositories of sound effects.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM team wins Query-by-Vocal Imitation Challenge","date":"Monday, 8 September 2025","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ac1cc7c4c269a84076b622a95d18bb09/d61e8/QVIM.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ac1cc7c4c269a84076b622a95d18bb09/ac96e/QVIM.jpg 342w,\n/static/ac1cc7c4c269a84076b622a95d18bb09/d013f/QVIM.jpg 683w,\n/static/ac1cc7c4c269a84076b622a95d18bb09/d61e8/QVIM.jpg 1366w","sizes":"(min-width: 1366px) 1366px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ac1cc7c4c269a84076b622a95d18bb09/f2eb1/QVIM.webp 342w,\n/static/ac1cc7c4c269a84076b622a95d18bb09/46882/QVIM.webp 683w,\n/static/ac1cc7c4c269a84076b622a95d18bb09/4fad6/QVIM.webp 1366w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1366px) 1366px, 100vw"}]},"width":1366,"height":768}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2025-09-08.C4DM-team_wins_QbVI_challenge","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2025-09-08.C4DM-team_wins_QbVI_challenge/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2025-09-08.C4DM-team_wins_QbVI_challenge","crumbLabel":"2025-09-08.C4DM-team_wins_QbVI_challenge"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
