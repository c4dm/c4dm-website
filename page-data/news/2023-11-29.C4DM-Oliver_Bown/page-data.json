At its heart is a sociotechnical analysis that seeks to characterise human creativity in art and music in such a way as to admit and make sense of an emerging machine agency. To do this I draw on a distinction between two ways in which we understand creativity: one, adaptive creativity, that is intrinsically linked with human psychology and is goal oriented, and another, generative creativity, which is a more emergent phenomenon more closely associated with social level processes, and is not goal oriented. In this context I present two recent projects, one examining the dialogic creative potential of GPT and another looking at how startup culture is engaging with music AI.</p>\n<p><b>Bio</b>: <a href=\"http://www.olliebown.com/\">http://www.olliebown.com/</a></p>\n<p>C4DM SEMINAR 11-12:00pm</p>\n<p>LUNCH BREAK 12-1:30pm</p>\n<p>After the talk, we will head somewhere nearby for lunch, please join us!</p>\n<p>PhD WORKSHOP 1:30-3pm</p>\n<p>In the afternoon following Oliver's talk, we will hold a mini workshop on creative music AI research and innovation.  We invite contributions from work in progress across C4DM/AIM/MAT.  The aim is to encourage dialogue around related topics so that presenters will give short 10-minute presentations followed by a roundtable discussion.</p>\n<p>PhD students interested in participating in the workshop should email me (<a href=\"mailto:c.saitis@qmul.ac.uk\">c.saitis@qmul.ac.uk</a>) by Monday 27 November at 12pm with a title and (very) short description of their research, including one or two questions they would like to see discussed at the roundtable.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Oliver Bown","date":"Wednesday, 29 November 2023","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2023-11-29.C4DM-Oliver_Bown","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2023-11-29.C4DM-Oliver_Bown/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2023-11-29.C4DM-Oliver_Bown","crumbLabel":"2023-11-29.C4DM-Oliver_Bown"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
