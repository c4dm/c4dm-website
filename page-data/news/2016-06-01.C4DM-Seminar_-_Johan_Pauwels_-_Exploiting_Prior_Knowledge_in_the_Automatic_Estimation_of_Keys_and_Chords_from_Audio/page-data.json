Its purpose is to introduce myself to the C4DM community and to identify areas of possible collaboration.</p>\n<p>The main topic of my doctoral work was the joint estimation of chords and keys. The underlying idea is that it allows to model harmony in a way that is easier to interpret musically. I’ve distinguished multiple types of prior knowledge and examined multiple sources to derive this knowledge from. I will further talk about the extent to which this contributes to the automatic labelling of keys and chords and about the influence of the mutual dependency between keys and chords. The talk will end with an extension towards structure estimation from harmony and the presentation of some tools that could possibly be reused.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">Bio</span></br>\nJohan Pauwels recently joined the C4DM as a postdoc to work on the FAST and AudioCommons projects. He studied Electrical Engineering and Artificial Intelligence at KULeuven (Belgium). Since 2008, he’s been active in music research, mainly harmony related, at Ghent University (Belgium) and IRCAM (Paris, France).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Johan Pauwels - Exploiting Prior Knowledge in the Automatic Estimation of Keys and Chords from Audio","date":"Wednesday, 1 June 2016","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2016-06-01.C4DM-Seminar_-_Johan_Pauwels_-_Exploiting_Prior_Knowledge_in_the_Automatic_Estimation_of_Keys_and_Chords_from_Audio","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2016-06-01.C4DM-Seminar_-_Johan_Pauwels_-_Exploiting_Prior_Knowledge_in_the_Automatic_Estimation_of_Keys_and_Chords_from_Audio/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2016-06-01.C4DM-Seminar_-_Johan_Pauwels_-_Exploiting_Prior_Knowledge_in_the_Automatic_Estimation_of_Keys_and_Chords_from_Audio","crumbLabel":"2016-06-01.C4DM-Seminar_-_Johan_Pauwels_-_Exploiting_Prior_Knowledge_in_the_Automatic_Estimation_of_Keys_and_Chords_from_Audio"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
