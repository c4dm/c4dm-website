Ryan Stables, the event organiser, and others at the Digital Media Technology (DMT) Lab in Birmingham City University are currently collaborating with C4DM on the Semantic Audio Feature Extraction (SAFE) project. <a href=\"http://www.terasoft.com.tw/conf/ismir2014/LBD/LBD15.pdf\">More information on this project can be found here</a></p>\n<p>Josh Reiss will present a summary of the current state of the art in Intelligent Music Production, highlighting current research directions and the implications of this technology. Brecht De Man will present some of his PhD results in perceptual evaluation of music production as he attempts to understand how mix engineers carry out their work. Further to this, Alex Wilson was a previous C4DM visiting student for six months, and will be presenting his recently publishing work from Sound and Music Computing Conference, in navigating the mix space.</p>\n<p>More information on the workshop, including abstracts and registration, can be found here <a href=\"http://www.aes-uk.org/forthcoming-meetings/aes-midlands-workshop-on-intelligent-music-production/\">http://www.aes-uk.org/forthcoming-meetings/aes-midlands-workshop-on-intelligent-music-production/</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"AES Workshop on Intelligent Music Production","date":"Thursday, 27 August 2015","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2015-08-27.AES-Workshop_on_Intelligent_Music_Production","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2015-08-27.AES-Workshop_on_Intelligent_Music_Production/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2015-08-27.AES-Workshop_on_Intelligent_Music_Production","crumbLabel":"2015-08-27.AES-Workshop_on_Intelligent_Music_Production"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
