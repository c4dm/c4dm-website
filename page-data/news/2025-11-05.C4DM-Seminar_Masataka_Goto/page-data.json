Mile Eng campus, Eng building, room G2</p>\n<h2><b>Title</b>: Advancing Music Experience Through Music Information Research</h2>\n<p><b>Abstract</b>:\nMusic technologies will open up new ways of enjoying music, both in terms of creating and appreciating music. In this talk, I will discuss how music information research can enrich music experiences by introducing examples of our research outcomes. For example, \"Lyric Apps\" offer a new form of lyric-driven visual art, dynamically rendering different visual content based on user interaction. After releasing \"TextAlive App API\", a web-based framework for creating lyric apps, which has received several awards including at ACM CHI 2023, we have held annual programming contests since 2020. Another example is \"Kiite Cafe\", a web service that allows users to get together virtually to listen to music. It lets users enjoy the same song simultaneously while reacting in real time, creating a shared listening experience, and has also received multiple awards. In the future, further advances in music information research will make interactions between people and music more active and enriching.</p>\n<p><b>Bio</b>:\nMasataka Goto received the Doctor of Engineering degree from Waseda University in 1998.
