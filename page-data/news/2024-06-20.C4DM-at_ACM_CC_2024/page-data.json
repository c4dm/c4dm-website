C&#x26;C is a leading international conference that brings together researchers and practitioners from various disciplines to explore technologies wide impacts on creativity, from designing and working with AI tools, to the social and cultural aspects of creativity.</p>\n<p>The following paper received an <b>honorable mention award</b> at the conference:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/97327/Ford%20Reflection%20Across%20AI-based%202024%20Accepted.pdf?sequence=2&#x26;isAllowed=y\">Reflection Across AI-based Music Composition</a>, by Corey Ford, Ashley Noel-Hirst, Sara Cardinale, Jackson Loth, Pedro Sarmento, Elizabeth Wilson, Lewis Wolstanholme, Kyle Worrall and Nick Bryan-Kinns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The paper collects first-person accounts, interview and questionnaire measures, on how several C4DM researchers used AI tools of their choice in their music making, contributing descriptions of how they reflected when using AI generated content.</p>\n<p>C4DM members <a href=\"https://ashleynoelhirst.co.uk/\">Ashley Noel-Hirst</a> and <a href=\"http://codetta.codes/\">Corey Ford</a> are also co-authors of the paper:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ualresearchonline.arts.ac.uk/id/eprint/22055/1/incongrous_unmarked.pdf\">Using Incongruous Genres to Explore Music Making with AI Generated Content</a>, by Nick Bryan-Kinns, Ashley Noel-Hirst, and Corey Ford.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The paper explores how an AI tool trained on a Folk dataset is used and appropriated by musicians in the genres of both, as a playful way to explore Human-AI Interaction.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://xaixarts.github.io/2024\">2nd international workshop on eXplainable AI for the Arts</a> is also run at the conference, co-organized by C4DM members Corey Ford and Shuoyang Zheng. This workshop examines the challenges and opportunities at the intersection of explainable AI and the Arts, offering a critical view on the explainable aspects of Responsible AI and Human-Centred AI. With an accepted paper from C4DM of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Mapping Strategy for Interacting with Latent Audio Synthesis Using Artistic Materials by Shuoyang Zheng, Anna Xambó Sedó and Nick Bryan-Kinns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The paper describes how mapping sketches to the latent space of the audio synthesis RAVE model can be used to support temporal and cross-modal aspects of explainable AI.
