Although, the superior aim is to improve their understanding of new forms of music making and increase their interest in STEM subjects such as computer science and physics. In practice, three groups of 36 secondary school students, among them one girls-only group, participated in the project over the course of one school year. They started with trying out existing instruments and music games. Then the students created playful possibilities to interact with music in a series of workshops with musicians, game designers and music technology experts. Finally, they created their own very different music instruments. The centrepiece and starting point of each instrument was an empty circuit board specially designed for Sparkling Instruments. Apart from that, the students used common electronics components as well as wood, textiles, foil, 3D printed objects or any other material of their choice. In a closing public event, each group performed in a concert using their own musical instruments.</p>\n<p><b>Bio</b>:\nDr. Oliver Hodl works as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Vienna with an interest in Human-Computer Interaction, music and design. His research foci are interaction design, studying user experiences, art-based research approaches, and HCI-related qualitative and quantitative research methods. With the Trombosonic, he developed an award-winning new digital music instrument.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar : Oliver Hodl","date":"Monday, 23 September 2019","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2019-09-23.Oliver-Hodl_Seminar","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2019-09-23.Oliver-Hodl_Seminar/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2019-09-23.Oliver-Hodl_Seminar","crumbLabel":"2019-09-23.Oliver-Hodl_Seminar"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
