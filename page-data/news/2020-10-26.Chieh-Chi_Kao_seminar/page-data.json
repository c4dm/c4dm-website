In the past two years, many customer-facing AED products have been released to the market. In this talk, we will have a case study of Alexa Guard, which is a service utilizing AED technologies to help customers protect their home. We will also cover recent research progress on AED done at Amazon Alexa, including novel model architectures, knowledge distillation, and model compression.</p>\n<p><b>Bio</b>:\nChieh-Chi Kao is currently an applied scientist with Amazon Alexa, where he works on the modeling for applications of acoustic event detection. His research interests include acoustic event detection, environmental sound analysis, and active learning. He has published 10+ papers in AED related topics at Interspeech and ICASSP. Prior to joining Amazon Alexa, he was a PhD candidate in electrical and computer engineering at University of California, Santa Barbara and had done several research internships at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Chieh-Chi Kao (Amazon Alexa)","date":"Monday, 26 October 2020","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2020-10-26.Chieh-Chi_Kao_seminar","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2020-10-26.Chieh-Chi_Kao_seminar/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2020-10-26.Chieh-Chi_Kao_seminar","crumbLabel":"2020-10-26.Chieh-Chi_Kao_seminar"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
