He received his B.Tech. and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur. He did a postdoc at Oxford University (UK), where he developed speech recognition systems using linguistic principles. Then he worked at Amazon in Boston (USA), where he worked on audio classification for developing the Alexa home security system. His current research interest is in developing machine learning algorithms for audio and signal processing. He works on model adaptation, uncertainty modelling and generative machine learning. <a href=\"http://home.iitk.ac.in/~vipular/\">http://home.iitk.ac.in/~vipular/</a></p>\n<p><b>Abstract</b>:\nDeep-learning-based models achieve remarkable performances with big labelled data. However, many practical scenarios face a scarcity of labelled data, while there may still be an abundance of unlabelled data. This talk will discuss several methods to learn effectively from small data. These methods mostly fall under the paradigm of model adaptation and include fine-tuning-based transfer learning, meta-learning, and semi-supervised domain adaptation. These methodsâ€™ application to music melody estimation and sensor calibration (regression) problems will be demonstrated. Another way to learn from limited data is by using conditional models. This method will be illustrated for generative machine learning applied to XY models in statistical Physics and field theories in Particle physics. Time permitting, there will be a brief presentation on audio retrieval.</p>\n<p><b>Video recording</b>: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_AS8_NNtWw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_AS8_NNtWw</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Dr. Vipul Arora","date":"Tuesday, 11 October 2022","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2022-10-11.C4DM-Seminar_-_Vipul_Arora_-_Model_Adaptation_for_Learning_from_Small_Data","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2022-10-11.C4DM-Seminar_-_Vipul_Arora_-_Model_Adaptation_for_Learning_from_Small_Data/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2022-10-11.C4DM-Seminar_-_Vipul_Arora_-_Model_Adaptation_for_Learning_from_Small_Data","crumbLabel":"2022-10-11.C4DM-Seminar_-_Vipul_Arora_-_Model_Adaptation_for_Learning_from_Small_Data"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
