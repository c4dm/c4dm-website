Musictranscription is a fundamental task in AI based music tasks, which aims attranscribing audio recordings into symbolic representations. This work proposeda high-resolution piano transcription system including transcribing piano notesand sustain-pedals. All of onset, offsets and velocities information aretranscribed. Using this piano transcription system, we created aGiantMIDI-Piano dataset including 10,854 unique automatically transcribed pianoMIDI files. We analyzed the GiantMIDI-Piano dataset and show musical analysisof some classical music pieces. GiantMIDI-Piano dataset can be used but notlimited to automatic music generation and musical analysis.</p>\n<p><b>Bio</b>:\nQiuqiang Kong started his Ph.D. study at Centrefor Digital Music (C4DM), Queen Mary University of London in 2015, and receivedhis Ph.D. degree from University of Surrey, Guildford, UK in 2020. Followinghis PhD, he joined ByteDance AI Lab as a research scientist. His research topicincludes the classification, detection and separation of general sounds andmusic.</p>\n<p><b>Presentation Slides</b>:\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V5j1kTt2wwnK2EhHMzbyBu0Z5b_vId9N/view?usp=sharing\">music_transcription_giantmidi-piano_qiuqiangkong.pdf</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Qiuqiang Kong","date":"Wednesday, 3 November 2021","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2021-11-03.C4DM-Seminar_-_Qiuqiang_Kong_-_High-resolution_Piano_Transcription_System_and_GiantMIDI-Piano_Dataset","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2021-11-03.C4DM-Seminar_-_Qiuqiang_Kong_-_High-resolution_Piano_Transcription_System_and_GiantMIDI-Piano_Dataset/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2021-11-03.C4DM-Seminar_-_Qiuqiang_Kong_-_High-resolution_Piano_Transcription_System_and_GiantMIDI-Piano_Dataset","crumbLabel":"2021-11-03.C4DM-Seminar_-_Qiuqiang_Kong_-_High-resolution_Piano_Transcription_System_and_GiantMIDI-Piano_Dataset"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
