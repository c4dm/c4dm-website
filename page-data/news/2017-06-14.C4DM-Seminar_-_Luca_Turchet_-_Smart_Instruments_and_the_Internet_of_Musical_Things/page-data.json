These are characterized by embedded computational intelligence, bidirectional wireless connectivity, an embedded sound delivery system, and an onboard system for feedback to the player. Smart Instruments bring together separate strands of augmented instrument, networked music and Internet of Things technology, offering direct point-to-point communication between each other and other portable sensor-enabled devices, without need for a central mediator such as a laptop. This technological infrastructure enables an ecosystem of interoperable devices connecting performers as well as performers and audiences, which can support new performer-performer and audience-performer interactions. This has paved the way for the definition of the Internet of Musical Things (IoMUT), where the concept of the Internet of Things is extended to the musical domain. IoMUT refers to the network of computing devices embedded in physical objects (Musical Things) dedicated to the production and/or reception of musical content. Musical Things, such as Smart Instruments or smart devices, are connected by an infrastructure that enables multidirectional communication, both locally and remotely. The IoMUT digital ecosystem gathers interoperable devices and services that connect performers and audiences to support performer-performer and audience-performers interactions, not possible beforehand.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">Bio</span></br>\nLuca Turchet is a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Digital Music. His research interests span the fields of new interfaces for musical expression, human-computer interaction, perception, and virtual reality. He is also a musician and composer.\nHe holds degrees with honors in Computer Sciences from University of Verona, Composition and Classical Guitar from Conservatory of Music of Verona, and Electroacoustic Music from KMH Royal College of Music of Stockholm. He received the Ph.D. in Sonic Interaction Design at the Media Technology Department of the Aalborg University Copenhagen. He is author and co-author of 45 papers and has been awarded of research grants from the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Danish Research Council, and the European Commission.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Luca Turchet - The Smart Instruments and the Internet of Musical Things","date":"Wednesday, 14 June 2017","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2017-06-14.C4DM-Seminar_-_Luca_Turchet_-_Smart_Instruments_and_the_Internet_of_Musical_Things","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2017-06-14.C4DM-Seminar_-_Luca_Turchet_-_Smart_Instruments_and_the_Internet_of_Musical_Things/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2017-06-14.C4DM-Seminar_-_Luca_Turchet_-_Smart_Instruments_and_the_Internet_of_Musical_Things","crumbLabel":"2017-06-14.C4DM-Seminar_-_Luca_Turchet_-_Smart_Instruments_and_the_Internet_of_Musical_Things"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
