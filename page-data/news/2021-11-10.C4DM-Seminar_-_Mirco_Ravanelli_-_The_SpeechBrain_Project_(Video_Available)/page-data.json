It is designed to facilitate the research and development of speech and language technologies by being simple, flexible, user-friendly, and well-documented. This talk describes the core architecture designed to support several tasks of common interest, allowing users to naturally conceive, compare and share novel conversational AI pipelines. SpeechBrain achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of benchmarks. It also provides training recipes, pretrained models, and inference scripts for popular datasets, as well as tutorials that allow anyone with basic Python proficiency to familiarize themselves with speech technologies. The talk will also discuss the future research direction for this project and share some ideas for the future development of intelligent speaking machines.</p>\n<p><b>Video</b>:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://youtu.be/TfgnmfxsPXY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><b>Bio</b>:\nMirco Ravanelli is a postdoc researcher at Université de Montréal, working under Prof. Yoshua Bengio's supervision. He will soon join Concordia University as an Assistant Professor and the Université de Montréal as an adjunct professor. His main research interests are deep learning and Conversational AI. Mirco is the author or co-author of more than 50 papers on these research topics. He received his Ph.D. (with cum laude distinction) from the University of Trento in December 2017. Mirco is an active member of the speech and machine learning communities. He is the founder and leader of the SpeechBrain project.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Mirco Ravanelli","date":"Wednesday, 10 November 2021","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2021-11-10.C4DM-Seminar_-_Mirco_Ravanelli_-_The_SpeechBrain_Project_(Video_Available)","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2021-11-10.C4DM-Seminar_-_Mirco_Ravanelli_-_The_SpeechBrain_Project_(Video_Available)/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2021-11-10.C4DM-Seminar_-_Mirco_Ravanelli_-_The_SpeechBrain_Project_(Video_Available)","crumbLabel":"2021-11-10.C4DM-Seminar_-_Mirco_Ravanelli_-_The_SpeechBrain_Project_(Video_Available)"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
