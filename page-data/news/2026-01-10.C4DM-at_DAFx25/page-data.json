was held from 2nd to 5th September 2025 at the historic Mole Vanvitelliana in Ancona, Italy.\nDAFx is a leading international conference dedicated to the exploration of digital audio effects, signal processing, and related technologies.</p>\n<p>Day one consisted of a series of tutorials, covering topics such as non-iterative numerical simulation, filter design with logarithmic frequency resolution, to differentiable pipelines for feedback delay networks and acoustic environment editation.\nThe remaining days featured a rich technical program, including oral and poster presentations, interesting demos, and keynote talks from renowned researchers in the field.\nThe banquet on the second day was located at the other side of city, in the beautiful setting of the MaWay restaurant, overlooking the Adriatic Sea, featuring amazing seafood and risotto dishes.\nThe next day concluded with an amazing electronic sound and video performance at the conference venue, featuring a selection of Italian vintage synthesisers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./dafx25_concert.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This time C4DM had three technical papers accepted at DAFx 2025, focusing on the theme of <strong>differentiable systems</strong> in different paradigms and applications.</p>\n<p>The first paper, titled <a href=\"https://www.dafx.de/paper-archive/2025/DAFx25_paper_35.pdf\">Fast Differentiable Modal Simulation of Non-Linear Strings, Membranes, and Plates</a>, was presented by PhD student Rodrigo Diaz.\nThis work develop GPU-accelerated and differentiable implementations for physical modelling of musical instruments, focusing on modal synthesis of strings, membranes, and plates with non-linear effects.\nThe resulting implementations in JAX can be accessed <a href=\"https://github.com/rodrigodzf/jaxdiffmodal\">here</a>.\nThis work makes differentiable simulations easy to use, effectively bridging classical modal techniques with modern automatic differentiation methods.</p>\n<p>The second paper, titled <a href=\"https://www.dafx.de/paper-archive/2025/DAFx25_paper_54.pdf\">Differentiable Attenuation Filters for Feedback Delay Networks</a>, was presented by PhD student Ilias Ibnyahya.\nThis work focus on designing the attenutation filters used in feedback loop of feedback delay networks (FDNs) for artificial reverberation.\nCascaded second-order sections are used and shared across all delay lines, reducing the number of parameters needed.\nThe proposed design is differentiable, allowing for end-to-end optimisation of the FDN parameters using gradient-based methods.\nThe source code is available <a href=\"https://github.com/ilias-audio/iir_match\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The last paper, titled <a href=\"https://www.dafx.de/paper-archive/2025/DAFx25_paper_9.pdf\">DiffVox: A Differentiable Model for Capturing and Analysing Vocal Effects Distributions</a>, was presented by PhD student Chin-Yun Yu.\nThis work introduces DiffVox, a chain of differentiable audio effects implemented in PyTorch.\nDiffVox consists of a parametric equaliser, a dynamic range compressor, a ping-pong delay, and a FDN-based reverb.\nThe effects were implemented in a way that is fast to evaluate, differentiable, but still represents the original audio effect well.\nIn collaboration with Sony AI, DiffVox was optimised on hundreds of proprietary solo vocal tracks processed with various vocal effects.\nThe resultings presets were analysed and visualised to understand the distributions of real-world effects settings.\nThe source code is available <a href=\"https://github.com/SonyResearch/diffvox\">here</a>.\nAn <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/yoyolicoris/diffvox\">interactive demo</a> on huggingface was also demonstrated on the last day of the conference.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM at DAFx 2025","date":"Saturday, 10 January
