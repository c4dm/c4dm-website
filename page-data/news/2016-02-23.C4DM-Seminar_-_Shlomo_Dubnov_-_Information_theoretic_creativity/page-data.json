In the talk I will survey some of the recent works on controlling or \"guiding\" such models according to user specifications. Specifically I will describe the work done in UCSD / CREL on Variable Markov Oracle modeling that allows optimal model selection for audio signals, with applications to motif detection and guided improvisation, as well as other time series applications*. The general framework of our work is rooted in information theoretical approaches that use notions of complexity and accuracy to combine analytical and generative models in a common framework.</p>\n<p>(*) <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/mu/2015/04/mmu2015040052.pdf\">https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/mu/2015/04/mmu2015040052.pdf</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">Bio</span></br>\nShlomo Dubnov is a Professor in UCSD Music Department and affiliate faculty in Computer Science and Engineering.
