This makes it possible for performers to explore sounds beyond the traditional timbres of the violin. The current research is focused on augmenting the expressivity of the violin toward novel timbral possibilities, as opposed to simulations of traditional acoustic violin bodies. The presentation includes several practical approaches to sensor/actuator augmentation and extended playing techniques that can be applied to bowed-string or other instruments, in order to provide creative control over the possibilities offered by various Digital Signal Processing algorithms. Acoustically-emanating sounds and effects can be controlled via a musician’s movements. For example, gestures tracked by a variety of sensors can be used to extend the techniques of the player’s performance to include real-time control over the new sonic possibilities.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">Bio</span></br>\nDan Overholt is an Associate Professor at Aalborg University Copenhagen. His research interests include advanced technologies for interactive interfaces and novel audio signal processing algorithms, with a focus on new techniques for creating music and interactive sound. He is involved in the development of tangible interfaces and control strategies for processing human gestural inputs that allow interaction with of a variety of audiovisual systems. Dan is also a composer, improviser, inventor and instrument builder who performs internationally with his new musical instruments and custom sound synthesis and processing algorithms. Dr. Overholt received a PhD in Media Arts and Technology from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a M.S. in Media Arts and Sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has about 40 peer-reviewed publications and two patents (one provisional).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Daniel Overholt - Augmented Expressivity for Acoustic Instruments: Actuation and Gestural Control","date":"Monday, 6 March 2017","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2017-03-06.C4DM-Seminar_-_Daniel_Overholt_-_Augmented_Expressivity_for_Acoustic_Instruments_(Video_Available)","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2017-03-06.C4DM-Seminar_-_Daniel_Overholt_-_Augmented_Expressivity_for_Acoustic_Instruments_(Video_Available)/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2017-03-06.C4DM-Seminar_-_Daniel_Overholt_-_Augmented_Expressivity_for_Acoustic_Instruments_(Video_Available)","crumbLabel":"2017-03-06.C4DM-Seminar_-_Daniel_Overholt_-_Augmented_Expressivity_for_Acoustic_Instruments_(Video_Available)"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
