Such applications should be delivered widely, effectively,\nand accurately, harnessing the synergy of sound and music computing (SMC), wearable computing, and\ncloud computing technologies to promote learning and to facilitate disease prevention, diagnosis,\nand treatment in both developed countries and resource-poor developing countries. In this talk,\nI will highlight our recent projects at NUS Sound and Music Computing Lab that are developed to\nfacilitate joyful learning, and motivate physical Rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>Biography :\nWang Ye is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at the National University of Singapore (NUS)\nand NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering (NGS). He established and directed\nthe sound and music computing (SMC) Lab (<a href=\"http://www.smcnus.org\">www.smcnus.org</a>). Before joining NUS he was a member of the\ntechnical staff at Nokia Research Center in Tampere, Finland for 9 years. His research interests include\nsound analysis and music information retrieval (MIR), mobile computing, and cloud computing, and their\napplications in music edutainment, e-Learning, and e-Health, as well as determining their effectiveness\nvia subjective and objective evaluations. He has served as the general chair of ISMIR2017\n(<a href=\"https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/\">https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/</a>) and TPC co-chair of ICOT2017 (<a href=\"http://www.colips.org/conferences/icot2017/\">http://www.colips.org/conferences/icot2017/</a>).\nHis most recent projects involve the design and evaluation of systems to support 1) therapeutic gait training\nusing Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS), 2) auditory training and second language learning.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Seminar Prof. Ye Wang","date":"Wednesday, 23 May 2018","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2018-05-23.YE-WANG_SEMINAR","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2018-05-23.YE-WANG_SEMINAR/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2018-05-23.YE-WANG_SEMINAR","crumbLabel":"2018-05-23.YE-WANG_SEMINAR"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
