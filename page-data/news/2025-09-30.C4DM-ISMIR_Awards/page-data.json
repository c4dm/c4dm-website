The paper \"<a href=\"https://ismir2025program.ismir.net/poster_7.html\">Audio Synthesizer Inversion in Symmetric Parameter Spaces With Approximately Equivariant Flow Matching</a>\" proposes using permutation equivariant continuous normalizing flows to handle the ill-posed problem of audio synthesizer inversion, where multiple parameter configurations can produce identical sounds due to intrinsic symmetries in synthesizer design. By explicitly modeling these symmetries, particularly permutation invariance across repeated components like oscillators and filters, the method outperforms both regression-based approaches and symmetry-naive generative models on both synthetic tasks and a real-world synthesizer (Surge XT).</p>\n<p>We are also happy to share that two C4DM PhD students, Yannis Vasilakis and Ben Hayes, were recognised as outstanding reviewers.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Best student paper and outstanding reviewer awards at ISMIR 2025","date":"Tuesday, 30 September 2025","author":"Christos Plachouras","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8b8b8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0d9bd1939a6f78714877cb0f2df8af8a/6e1b1/c4dm_ismir_2025_awards.png","srcSet":"/static/0d9bd1939a6f78714877cb0f2df8af8a/3ce1d/c4dm_ismir_2025_awards.png 239w,\n/static/0d9bd1939a6f78714877cb0f2df8af8a/a3e1e/c4dm_ismir_2025_awards.png 477w,\n/static/0d9bd1939a6f78714877cb0f2df8af8a/6e1b1/c4dm_ismir_2025_awards.png 954w","sizes":"(min-width: 954px) 954px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0d9bd1939a6f78714877cb0f2df8af8a/87c34/c4dm_ismir_2025_awards.webp 239w,\n/static/0d9bd1939a6f78714877cb0f2df8af8a/1bb88/c4dm_ismir_2025_awards.webp 477w,\n/static/0d9bd1939a6f78714877cb0f2df8af8a/4fc09/c4dm_ismir_2025_awards.webp 954w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 954px) 954px, 100vw"}]},"width":954,"height":772}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2025-09-30.C4DM-ISMIR_Awards","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2025-09-30.C4DM-ISMIR_Awards/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2025-09-30.C4DM-ISMIR_Awards","crumbLabel":"2025-09-30.C4DM-ISMIR_Awards"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
