Surprisingly this rather important research\narea has received little attention.  A reason is the fact that while the concept\nof dynamics is related to signal amplitude, which is a  low-level feature, the\nprocess of deriving perceived loudness from the signal is far from\nstraightforward.</p>\n<p>The PhD thesis presented advances the state of the art in the analysis of\nperceived  loudness by modelling dynamic variations in expressive music\nperformance and by studying the relation between dynamics in piano recordings\nand markings in the score.  In particular, we show that dynamic changes: a)\ndepend on the evolution of the  performance and the local context of the piece;\nb) correspond to important score  markings and music structures; and, c) can\nreflect wide divergences in performers' expressive strategies within and across\npieces.</p>\n<p>All studies in this thesis are based on loudness levels extracted from 2000\nrecordings of 44 Mazurkas by F. Chopin. The research can be broadly categorised\ninto two parts. The first  investigates how dynamic markings map to performed\nloudness levels. Empirical results show that different dynamic markings do not\ncorrespond to fixed loudness thresholds.  Rather, the important factors are the\nrelative loudness of neighbouring markings, the  inter-relations of nearby\nmarkings and other score information, the structural location of the markings,\nand the creative license exercised by the performer in inserting further\ninterpretive dynamic shaping. The second part seeks to determine how changes in\nloudness  levels map to score features using statistical change-point\ntechniques. The results show that significant dynamic score markings do indeed\ncorrespond to change points. Furthermore,  evidence suggests that change points\nin score positions without dynamic markings highlight  structurally salient\nevents or events based on temporal changes.</p>\n<p>In a separate bidirectional study, we investigate the relationship between\ndynamic markings  in the score and performed loudness using machine learning\ntechniques. The techniques  are applied to the prediction of loudness levels\ncorresponding to dynamic markings, and to the classification of dynamic markings\ngiven loudness values. The results show that loudness  values and markings can\nbe predicted relatively well when trained across recordings of the same  piece,\nbut fail dismally when trained across a pianist's recordings of other pieces.\nThe findings  demonstrate that score features may trump individual style when\nmodelling loudness choices.  The analysis of the results reveal that form-such\nas the return of the theme- and structure-such as repetitions-influence\npredictability of loudness and markings.</p>\n<p>This research is a first step towards automatic audio-to-score transcription of\ndynamic markings.  This insight will serve as a tool for expression synthesis\nand musicological studies.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">Bio</span></br>\nKaterina Kosta is a graduate doctoral student at QMUL's Centre for Digital Music\nconducting research in dynamic variations in expressive music performance and a\nmachine learning researcher at Jukedeck.
