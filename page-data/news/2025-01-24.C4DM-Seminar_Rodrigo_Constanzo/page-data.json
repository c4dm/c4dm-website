He thinks this is an important thing to do. The art he makes is generally smeared in time, in the form of music. He improvises and acts as an antennae to the beauty, electricity, and endless surprise that is living a crazy life. He composes and tries to create new sounds, interactions and behaviors that he find interesting and challenging. He performs his own music and the music of others on a variety of instruments, with close friends. He believes in magic. He believes in sharing things. He believes in teaching. He believes in openness. He loves sweet jams, and avoids speaking with a complicated vocabulary as much as possible. He tries to live as presently and honestly as possible.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM & AIL Seminar: Rodrigo Constanzo","date":"Friday, 24 January 2025","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2025-01-24.C4DM-Seminar_Rodrigo_Constanzo","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2025-01-24.C4DM-Seminar_Rodrigo_Constanzo/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2025-01-24.C4DM-Seminar_Rodrigo_Constanzo","crumbLabel":"2025-01-24.C4DM-Seminar_Rodrigo_Constanzo"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
