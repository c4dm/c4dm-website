I'll show how we are slowly shifting our perspective of the instrument from its mechanical vibrations to a more sound-based, timbral description of them. I will also present some results derived from the collaboration with Sam Zigmuntowizc and his 20 years of data collection, and my new project with the Open String Foundation that searches to give conservatory-level instruments to children of underprivileged regions, using the latest results of our musical acoustic research for violin shape optimisation.</p>\n<p><b>Bio</b>: A physicist by training, earned his PhD in the Netherlands before a chance encounter with a 13th-generation family of violin makers from Germany stirred his fascination for the craft. This new interest, coupled with his experience running a guitar shop in Valparaiso, Chile, led him to Cremona, Italy in 2019. There, he delved into the acoustics of musical instruments at the Politecnico di Milano. Now, Sebastian combines his technical expertise with his love for music, utilizing computer simulations, artificial intelligence, and hands-on experiments to unravel the mechanics behind the unique sound of the violin.</p>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08610\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08610</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Sebastian Gonzalez","date":"Thursday, 2 November 2023","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/news.2023-11-02.C4DM-Seminar_Sebastian_Gonzalez","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/news.2023-11-02.C4DM-Seminar_Sebastian_Gonzalez/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/news.2023-11-02.C4DM-Seminar_Sebastian_Gonzalez","crumbLabel":"news.2023-11-02.C4DM-Seminar_Sebastian_Gonzalez"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
