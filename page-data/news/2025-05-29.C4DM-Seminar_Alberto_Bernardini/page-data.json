To overcome this challenge, there is a growing need for physically motivated models that are both computationally efficient and sufficiently accurate to be embedded in audio processing pipelines. In recent years, automatic differentiation techniques have opened new possibilities by enabling the direct optimization of physical model parameters using measured data. This development has given rise to hybrid modeling approaches that combine the interpretability and robustness of physics-based models with the adaptability and accuracy of data-driven methods. In this seminar, we will explore the emerging field of differentiable physical modeling for audio applications. We will present concrete examples including models of analog audio circuits for Virtual Analog Modeling, physical models of acoustic transducers such as loudspeakers and microphones, and artificial reverberation systems based on Delay Networks. These case studies will demonstrate how differentiable models can be leveraged to bridge simulation and machine learning in the design of modern audio processing systems.</p>\n<p><b>Bio</b>:\nAlberto Bernardini received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2012, and the M.S. degree (cum laude) in computer engineering and the Ph.D. degree (cum laude) in information engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2015 and 2019, respectively.
