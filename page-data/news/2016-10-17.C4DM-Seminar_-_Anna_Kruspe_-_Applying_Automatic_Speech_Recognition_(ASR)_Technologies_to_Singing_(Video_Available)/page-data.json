However, one aspect that has not\nreceived much attention so far is the lyrical content of singing voices.\nThis talk will provide an overview of my work on the application of\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies to singing. I will focus\non three topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Language Identification is the task of detecting the language of a singing recording</li>\n<li>Keyword Spotting is concerned with finding certain keywords in a collection of music</li>\n<li>Lyrics-to-singing alignment provides ways to attach known textual lyrics to singing recordings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will give short overviews of the state of the art of these topics,\npresent my own approaches (including two practical demonstrations), and\ntalk about the current possibilities and limitations in this field of\nresearch.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">Bio</span></br>\nAnna Kruspe is a researcher and Ph.D. student at Fraunhofer Institute\nfor Digital Media Technology (IDMT) in Ilmenau, Germany. In addition to\nher Ph.D. research on speech recognition for singing, she is currently\nworking on projects about automatic speech/music discrimination,\nrecommendation engines, and music classification for various industry\nclients.\nShe received her Master's degree in Media Technology from Ilmenau\nTechnical University (TU Ilmenau) in 2011. Her final thesis was on the\ntopic of classification of musical pieces into global cultural areas and\nwas supervised by Prof. Karlheinz Brandenburg. Prior to this, she worked\non various speech recognition tasks as an intern at Toshiba Research\nEurope Ltd.\nFor her final thesis, Anna Kruspe received the Hugo Geiger Prize of the\nFraunhofer Society. Her Ph.D. work is funded through a scholarship of\nthe Fraunhofer Society. From 2013 to 2014, she was an exchange\nresearcher at the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) of\nthe Johns Hopkins University and was advised by Prof. Hynek Hermansky.\nThis research stay was funded through a Fulbright scholarship.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Anna Kruspe - Applying Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Technologies to Singing","date":"Monday, 17 October 2016","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2016-10-17.C4DM-Seminar_-_Anna_Kruspe_-_Applying_Automatic_Speech_Recognition_(ASR)_Technologies_to_Singing_(Video_Available)","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2016-10-17.C4DM-Seminar_-_Anna_Kruspe_-_Applying_Automatic_Speech_Recognition_(ASR)_Technologies_to_Singing_(Video_Available)/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2016-10-17.C4DM-Seminar_-_Anna_Kruspe_-_Applying_Automatic_Speech_Recognition_(ASR)_Technologies_to_Singing_(Video_Available)","crumbLabel":"2016-10-17.C4DM-Seminar_-_Anna_Kruspe_-_Applying_Automatic_Speech_Recognition_(ASR)_Technologies_to_Singing_(Video_Available)"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
