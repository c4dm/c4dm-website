Following this there was further discussion on NMF followed by work on using bird songs as part of a musical composition.</p>\n<p>The poster session included work on auditory scene analysis, bird population vocalisation variations, CHiME: a sound source recognition dataset, technology assisted animal population size measures, bird identification through the use of identity vectors, and DTW for bird song dissimilarity.</p>\n<p>Further information on the presenters and posters is avaliable <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/listening-in-the-wild-2015-tickets-16237984248?aff=ebapi\">here</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM presents Listening In The Wild Workshop","date":"Friday, 28 August 2015","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2015-08-28.C4DM-Workshop_Listening_In_The_Wild","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2015-08-28.C4DM-Workshop_Listening_In_The_Wild/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2015-08-28.C4DM-Workshop_Listening_In_The_Wild","crumbLabel":"2015-08-28.C4DM-Workshop_Listening_In_The_Wild"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
