However, the mechanisms underlying\nthese associations generally remain theoretical, with neurological, cultural, and learning-focused mechansims\noften framed as being in competition.  This talk will begin by reconciling these mechanisms, suggesting that\nthey are are complimentary factors underlying the phenomena at different levels (e.g., proximate and ultimate).\nThe bulk of the talk will focus on recent empirical work which looks at cultural and cognitive mechanisms in\nlinguistic cross-modal associations, particularly between vowels and colours and non-words and shapes. These\nresults show that (i) culturally specific factors like vowel phoneme inventory and literacy can make make a\nfundamental contribution to shared cross-modal associations, but (ii) there remain trends which are well-explained\nby more general cognitive biases. Overall, this favours a complex systems view of cross-modal associations:\nwhile they likely have phylogenetically deep cognitive roots, they may well be reinforced and enriched by various\ncultural and environmental systems.</p>\n<p>Biography :\nDr Cuskley (ccuskley.github.io) has a background in Psychology and Linguistics and is broadly interested in\nthe evolution of social systems and cognition, with a particular focus on language. She has collaborated\nwith linguists, psychologists, and complex systems scientists to study issues surrounding the emergence,\nevolution, and dynamics of human language. Dr Cuskley is currently lecturer in Language and Cognition at\nNewcastle University, working in the School of English Language, Literature and Linguistcs and the Centre\nfor Behaviour and Evolution. She is also an associate researcher in the Centre for Language Evolution at\nthe University of Edinburgh.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Dr. Christine Cuskley","date":"Wednesday, 27 November 2019","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2019-11-27.CHRISTINE-CUSKLEY_SEMINAR","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2019-11-27.CHRISTINE-CUSKLEY_SEMINAR/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2019-11-27.CHRISTINE-CUSKLEY_SEMINAR","crumbLabel":"2019-11-27.CHRISTINE-CUSKLEY_SEMINAR"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
