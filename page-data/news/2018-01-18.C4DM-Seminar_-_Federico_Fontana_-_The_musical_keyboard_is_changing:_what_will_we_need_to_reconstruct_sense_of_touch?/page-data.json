The talk will deal with touch response, actually a key factor in piano and other keyboard instrument playing, whose credible virtualization must involve diverse aspects of the reproduction ranging from its accurate real-time synthesis to the auditory and tactile perception of sonic feedback. Detailing these aspects will be an occasion to present past and present research activities conducted by the speaker, in the fields of interactive sound processing and in the design and subjective evaluation of musical interfaces.</p>\n<p>Bio\nFederico Fontana is an associate professor in the Department of Mathematical, Computer and Physical Sciences at the University of Udine, teaching auditory-tactile interaction, object-oriented programming and computer networks. He is Coordinator of the Ph.D. in Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics at the University of Udine. He led research projects in the Sound and Music Computing and Interaction Design areas. He co-authored more than 100 international publications - <a href=\"https://people.uniud.it/page/federico.fontana\">https://people.uniud.it/page/federico.fontana</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Federico Fontana","date":"Thursday, 18 January 2018","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2018-01-18.C4DM-Seminar_-_Federico_Fontana_-_The_musical_keyboard_is_changing:_what_will_we_need_to_reconstruct_sense_of_touch?","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2018-01-18.C4DM-Seminar_-_Federico_Fontana_-_The_musical_keyboard_is_changing:_what_will_we_need_to_reconstruct_sense_of_touch?/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2018-01-18.C4DM-Seminar_-_Federico_Fontana_-_The_musical_keyboard_is_changing:_what_will_we_need_to_reconstruct_sense_of_touch?","crumbLabel":"2018-01-18.C4DM-Seminar_-_Federico_Fontana_-_The_musical_keyboard_is_changing:_what_will_we_need_to_reconstruct_sense_of_touch?"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
