At IPEM, we investigate ‘virtual embodiment,’ a concept that extends ‘naturalistic’ embodied music interaction into virtual (social) spaces. I'll present a series of experiments and creative-artistic applications on virtual embodiment in the domain of (remote) music performance, education, and dance.</p>\n<p><b>Bio</b>: My research is situated in the field of systematic musicology, focusing on embodied and social interaction with music. This research requires a cross-over of fundamental music research – including theory formation and experimental research – and music application development.\nLinks:\n<a href=\"https://research.flw.ugent.be/en/pieterjan.maes\">https://research.flw.ugent.be/en/pieterjan.maes</a>\n<a href=\"https://asil.ugent.be/team/ipem/\">https://asil.ugent.be/team/ipem/</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar:  Prof. Dr. Pieter-Jan Maes","date":"Thursday, 16 January 2025","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2025-01-16.C4DM-Seminar_Pieter-Jan_Maes","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2025-01-16.C4DM-Seminar_Pieter-Jan_Maes/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2025-01-16.C4DM-Seminar_Pieter-Jan_Maes","crumbLabel":"2025-01-16.C4DM-Seminar_Pieter-Jan_Maes"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
