While finding increasing acceptance as a scientific method, particularly where a visual representation of data is inadequate, it is still often derided as a ‘gimmick’. Composers have also shown growing interest in sonification as a compositional method. Both in science and in music, the criticism towards this method relates to poor aesthetics and gratuitous applications. My PhD portfolio used sonification as a musical methodology questioning the compositional intent, purpose, musical value and creative processes of a sonification composer. I argue for a more focused use of the method in musical applications in an effort to progress from 'hype' method to 'killer application'.</p>\n<p><b>Bio</b>:<br>\n<a href=\"http://nuriabo.net/\">http://nuriabo.net/</a><br>\nNuria Bonet is a composer and researcher based at the University of Plymouth. After studies in music, electroacoustic composition and acoustics at the University of Manchester and the University of Edinburgh, she completed a PhD Computer Music at the University of Plymouth under the supervision of Prof Eduardo Miranda and Dr Alexis Kirke. Nuria's PhD project looked at the use of sonification of compositional method. She also has research interests in organology and Catalan instruments in particular. Her research has been mentioned on BBC Radio 3, BBC Spotlight, Nature Physics, Physics World and Radio 100,7%, Catalunya Radio, Catalunya Musica and L'Avenç. Her current lottery-funded project, Back to Music, is developing new technologies and repertoire for disabled musicians.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Núria Bonet","date":"Friday, 20 March 2020","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2020-03-20.Nuria-Bonet_Seminar","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2020-03-20.Nuria-Bonet_Seminar/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2020-03-20.Nuria-Bonet_Seminar","crumbLabel":"2020-03-20.Nuria-Bonet_Seminar"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
