Øyvind Brandtsegg &#x26; Trond Engum then discussed Cross adaptive digital audio effects and their creative use in live performance. He referenced existing work at Queen Mary as some of the state of the art in existing work, and then presented NUTU’s current work on Cross Adaptive Audio Effects. The workshop day was rounded off with Xavier Serra discussing the Audio Commons project and use of open audio content.</p>\n<p>Day two opened with Marije Baalmans keynote on the range of hardware and software audio effects and synthesisers are available to artists, and how different artists utilise these effects. This talk was focused primarily on small embedded systems that artists use, such as Arduino, Beaglebone Black and Raspberry Pi. Later in the day, some excellent work including</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_7.pdf/e66b153c-1b7b-4c29-b13c-83197d5c7c92\">Granular Synthesis was presented by Sadjad Siddiq from Square Enix</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_4.pdf/d0e8cd6c-af41-4303-a81b-1c35d78ab5eb\">A collaboration on synthesising Percussive Drilling Sounds, between IRCAM and HUT</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_72.pdf/6940422d-a958-4698-b861-4aea48a615ee\">Using a modal reverberator structure to modify samples from CCRMA</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_19_v2.pdf/4f6d9373-5c7f-465a-b083-9f6f8587ff98\">Work on intelligent multitrack audio subgrouping by Dave Ronan from C4DM</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Day three began with an excellent introduction and summary of Wave Digital filters and Digital Wave Guides by Kurt Werner and Julius O.
