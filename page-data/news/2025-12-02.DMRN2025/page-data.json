Moreover, this annual gathering has a pre-history under other names, making it an institution that’s more like 25 years old! This year, we celebrate that history and the ever-growing presence of music computing in and around London. As well as the usual offering (top-notch research and friendly social atmosphere), we’ll also consider the past and future of DMRN, and the possible roles for a regionally organised network of this kind in the few (perhaps even 25) years. This event is hosted at KCL in collaboration with – but outside of – C4DM for the first time in many years, and takes the theme “Collaboration, Coordination, and Community”.</p>\n<p><b>Theme: “Collaboration, Coordination, and Community”.</b></p>\n<p>This years’ theme is “Collaboration, Coordination, and Community”. You may like to include a nod to this theme in your submission (this is optional!) and/or in your chats with others at the event. For example, you might like to discuss research communities at both local (e.g., DMRN) and global (e.g., ISMIR) scales. Likewise, you might give thought to the wider music scholarship communities with which we sometime have less interaction than we ought (e.g., ICMPC). And what about the much wider communities of musicians (professional and amateur) in London and beyond? What does successful collaborative, coordinated, and community-oriented work looks like, and what might DMRN’s role be?</p>\n<p>For further information, visit: <a href=\"https://www.qmul.ac.uk/dmrn/dmrn20/\">https://www.qmul.ac.uk/dmrn/dmrn20/</a></p>\n<p>Enquiries: Alvaro Bort (<a href=\"mailto:a.bort@qmul.ac.uk\">a.bort@qmul.ac.uk</a>)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"DMRN+20: Digital Music Research Network One-day Workshop 2025","date":"Tuesday, 2 December 2025","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8e8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6a96619ca934bdc4aee6bdedb3d8a3e9/c8c99/DMRN-logo.jpg","srcSet":"/static/6a96619ca934bdc4aee6bdedb3d8a3e9/01227/DMRN-logo.jpg 200w,\n/static/6a96619ca934bdc4aee6bdedb3d8a3e9/3fb31/DMRN-logo.jpg 400w,\n/static/6a96619ca934bdc4aee6bdedb3d8a3e9/c8c99/DMRN-logo.jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6a96619ca934bdc4aee6bdedb3d8a3e9/368e3/DMRN-logo.webp 200w,\n/static/6a96619ca934bdc4aee6bdedb3d8a3e9/3e8e4/DMRN-logo.webp 400w,\n/static/6a96619ca934bdc4aee6bdedb3d8a3e9/9a75b/DMRN-logo.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":204}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2025-12-02.DMRN2025","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2025-12-02.DMRN2025/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2025-12-02.DMRN2025","crumbLabel":"2025-12-02.DMRN2025"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
