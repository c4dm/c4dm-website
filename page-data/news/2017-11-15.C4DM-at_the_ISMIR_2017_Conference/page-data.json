ISMIR is a world-leading research conference that focuses on the processing, search, synthesis and modelling of musical data. In this highly-interdisciplinary annual conference researchers from academia and industry present their latest research, demos and ideas around the central theme of ‘music’.</p>\n<p>Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), through its Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) has been a regular participant to the conference, publishing several high impact papers in the recent years. This year too C4DM had a strong presence with participations both at the organisational and at the research programme level.</p>\n<p>On day two of the conference Prof. Elaine Chew, professor of Digital Media at QMUL and member of C4DM gave a <b>keynote</b> talk on <a href=\"https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/keynotes/\">“Structures: Performed, Perceived and Constructed”</a>.</p>\n<p>During the week C4DM researchers presented (oral or poster) the following <b>full length papers</b>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/12_Paper.pdf\">Transfer Learning for Music Classification and Regression Tasks</a> (Keunwoo Choi, György Fazekas, Mark Sandler, Kyunghyun Cho)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24_Paper.pdf\">Analysis of Interactive Intonation in Unaccompanied SATB Ensembles</a> (Jiajie Dai, Simon Dixon)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/59_Paper.pdf\">Geographical Origin Prediction of Folk Music Recordings from the United Kingdom</a> (Vytaute Kedyte, Maria Panteli, Tillman Weyde, Simon Dixon)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/216_Paper.pdf\">Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations for Music Content Analysis</a> (Saumitra Mishra, Bob L.

This session encourages researchers to present their work in progress, in the form of an extended abstract. C4DM had the following works accepted for the session:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/lbds/Liang2017.pdf\">Towards the Detection of Piano Pedalling Techniques from Audio Signal</a> (Beici Liang, György Fazekas and Mark Sandler)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/lbds/Kosta2017.pdf\">Dynamic Change Points in Music Audio Capture Dynamic Markings in Score</a> (Katerina Kosta, Rebecca Killick, Oscar F.

The work by Keunwoo Choi et.al. titled “Transfer Learning for Music Classification and Regression Tasks” employed the technique of transfer learning to use a neural network trained for music-auto tagging for other MIR tasks.</p>\n<p>On the organisational side, two members of C4DM were part of the <b>organising committee</b>. Professor Simon Dixon, deputy director of C4DM, was on the advisory board and Jiajie Dai, a third-year PhD student at C4DM, was local-organising co-chair.</p>\n<p><i>(Author: Saumitra Mishra - 15 November 2017)</i></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM at the ISMIR 2017 Conference","date":"Wednesday, 15 November 2017","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2017-11-15.C4DM-at_the_ISMIR_2017_Conference","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2017-11-15.C4DM-at_the_ISMIR_2017_Conference/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2017-11-15.C4DM-at_the_ISMIR_2017_Conference","crumbLabel":"2017-11-15.C4DM-at_the_ISMIR_2017_Conference"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
