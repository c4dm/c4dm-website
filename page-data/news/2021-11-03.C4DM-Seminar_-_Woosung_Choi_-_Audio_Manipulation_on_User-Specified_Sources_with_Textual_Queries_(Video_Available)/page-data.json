Decreasing the difficulty of audio editing will make more users create, edit, manipulate, and share their audio. This talk will introduce a prototype model called AMSS-Net for a next-generation interface for audio editing. AMSS-Net can perform source-aware audio manipulation according to a given textual query such as 'apply heavy lowpass to vocals, drums'. This talk will also cover relevant future works.</p>\n<p><b>Video</b>:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/papnEDGQs4Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><b>Bio</b>:\nWoosung Choi received his PhD degree from Korea University in 2021.\nCurrently, he is a postdoctoral visiting fellow at the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), based at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL).\nHe is interested in Machine Learning for audio and speech. Specifically, his research interests include speech enhancement, music source separation, source-aware audio manipulation, and multimodal learning for developing easy-to-use audio editing interfaces.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Woosung Choi","date":"Wednesday, 3 November 2021","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2021-11-03.C4DM-Seminar_-_Woosung_Choi_-_Audio_Manipulation_on_User-Specified_Sources_with_Textual_Queries_(Video_Available)","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2021-11-03.C4DM-Seminar_-_Woosung_Choi_-_Audio_Manipulation_on_User-Specified_Sources_with_Textual_Queries_(Video_Available)/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2021-11-03.C4DM-Seminar_-_Woosung_Choi_-_Audio_Manipulation_on_User-Specified_Sources_with_Textual_Queries_(Video_Available)","crumbLabel":"2021-11-03.C4DM-Seminar_-_Woosung_Choi_-_Audio_Manipulation_on_User-Specified_Sources_with_Textual_Queries_(Video_Available)"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
