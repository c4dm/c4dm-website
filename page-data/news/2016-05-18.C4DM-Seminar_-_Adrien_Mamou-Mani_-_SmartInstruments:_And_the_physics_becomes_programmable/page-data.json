However, active control of vibration makes it possible to tune dynamically the vibrational properties of an object without any mechanical change. The aim of SmartInstruments is to design acoustic instruments embedding active control systems that offer to the musician various sound qualities without external amplification and speaker. I will present the history and technical aspects of this project, and the uses of composers and musicians in various musical contexts and aesthetics.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">Bio</span></br>\nAdrien Mamou-Mani is the Head of Instrumental Acoustics team at Ircam, and a professor in musical acoustics at Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris (CNSMDP). His research interests include acoustics, mechanics, active control of vibration, and their applications to musical instruments design. He has collaborated with number of instrument makers (mostly string and wind instruments), musicians, and composers, and likes combining traditional know-how with scientific knowledge and new technology. Adrien holds a PhD in mechanics and acoustics from UPMC (Paris) and was a postdoctoral researcher at the Musée de la musique in Paris and at the Open University (UK). Adrien was awarded a Newton Fellowship and a Singer Polignac grant for his research, and was the principal investigator of a French National Agency project (ANR IMAREV).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Adrien Mamou-Mani - SmartInstruments: And the physics becomes programmable","date":"Wednesday, 18 May 2016","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2016-05-18.C4DM-Seminar_-_Adrien_Mamou-Mani_-_SmartInstruments:_And_the_physics_becomes_programmable","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2016-05-18.C4DM-Seminar_-_Adrien_Mamou-Mani_-_SmartInstruments:_And_the_physics_becomes_programmable/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2016-05-18.C4DM-Seminar_-_Adrien_Mamou-Mani_-_SmartInstruments:_And_the_physics_becomes_programmable","crumbLabel":"2016-05-18.C4DM-Seminar_-_Adrien_Mamou-Mani_-_SmartInstruments:_And_the_physics_becomes_programmable"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
