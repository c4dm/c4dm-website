Many sound and video examples will be shown.</p>\n<p><b>Video</b>:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrau192gQOs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><b>Bio</b>:\nStefan Bilbao (B.A. Physics, Harvard, 1992, MSc., PhD Electrical Engineering, Stanford, 1996 and 2001 respectively) is currently Professor of Acoustics and Audio Signal Processing in the Acoustics and Audio Group at the University of Edinburgh, and previously held positions at the Sonic Arts Research Centre, at the Queen's University Belfast, and the Stanford Space Telecommunications and Radioscience Laboratory. He has led the NESS project (Next Generation Sound Synthesis) and WRAM project (Wave-based Room Acoustics Modeling), both funded by the European Research Council, and running jointly between the Acoustics and Audio Group and the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre at the University of Edinburgh between 2012 and 2018.
