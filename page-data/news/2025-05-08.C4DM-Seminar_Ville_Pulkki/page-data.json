For example, ultrasonic superhearing allows to hear bats flying around, echolocating superhearing enables blind people to perceive reflections of ultrasonic clicks from surrounding environment, and underwater superhearing allows divers to better avoid hazardous boats.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Bio</b>:\nProf Ville Pulkki (Aalto University, Acoustics lab) has been active in the field of acoustics for 30 years, and a professor at Aalto University for 10 years. His doctoral thesis (and project work before that) focused on a technique for positioning virtual sources over multichannel loudspeaker arrays and delved also on perceptual side of the matter, both with subjective tests and binaural auditory models. After the PhD he used the gained knowledge on the resolution of human directional hearing to develop a parametric time-frequency-domain technique for reproduction of sound fields, a version of which has also been standardized recently. In addition to spatial audio, prof Pulkki has done research and teaching on communication acoustics. He co-authored theÂ textbook Communication Acoustics: An Introduction to Speech, Audio and Psychoacoustics (John Wiley &#x26; Sons 2015).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"EECS & C4DM Seminar: Prof Ville Pulkki","date":"Thursday, 8 May 2025","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2025-05-08.C4DM-Seminar_Ville_Pulkki","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2025-05-08.C4DM-Seminar_Ville_Pulkki/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2025-05-08.C4DM-Seminar_Ville_Pulkki","crumbLabel":"2025-05-08.C4DM-Seminar_Ville_Pulkki"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
