Motivated by its cost-effectiveness, our research explores the FDN topology and integrates it into a machine learning framework with the aim of defining a novel methodology for accurate real-time room simulation. We are working towards a new paradigm for Room Impulse Response synthesis, where accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and ease of application coexist.</p>\n<p>Sebastian: Acoustic measurements using sine sweeps are prone to background noise and non-stationary disturbances.\nRepeated measurements can be averaged to improve the resulting signal-to-noise ratio. However, averaging leads to poor\nrejection of non-stationary high-energy disturbances and, in the case of a time-variant environment, causes attenuation at\nhigh frequencies. This paper proposes a robust method to combine repeated sweep measurements using across-measurement\nmedian filtering in the time-frequency domain. The method, called Mosaic, successfully rejects non-stationary noise, sup-\npresses background noise and is more robust toward time variation than averaging. The proposed method allows high-\nquality measurement of impulse responses in a noisy environment.</p>\n<p><b>Bio</b>:\nGloria Dal Santo received the B.Sc. degree in Electronic and Communications Engineering from Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy, and the M.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2020 and 2022.
