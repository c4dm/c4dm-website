In this talk, I will bring to light the latest research on modelling human values through technological footprints, revealing individual, societal, and cultural forces. How these forces can be captured and most importantly, how they can be utilised in the design of persuasive technologies, promoting fairness, sensitivity and social inclusion.\nI will present a few case studies of applying computational methods to large amounts of digital data for understanding values associated with specific domains, including health, unemployment, and social inequalities. How and how much digital data can capture the behavioural differences in large populations is still an open issue, with various implications, including data and model bias, intervention designs, the use of persuasive technology and of course ethics.</p>\n<p><b>Bio</b>:<br>\nKyriaki Kalimeri is a researcher at the ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy and ISI Global Science Foundation, NYC USA. Previously she has been a research assistant at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy and visiting scholar at the Human Dynamics Group at MIT Media Lab, USA. She received her PhD degree from the University of Trento in 2013 and her Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Technical University of Crete in 2008. Her research concerns the use of social media in digital humanities, especially in charitable giving, social inequalities, as well as health informatics. Bridging machine learning and computational social science her work focuses on the automatic assessment of human and moral values, turning them into actionable insights for efficient communication campaigns that aim to increase engagement on critical social issues.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Kyriaki Kalimeri","date":"Wednesday, 11 March 2020","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2020-03-11.Kyriaki-Kalimeri_Seminar","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2020-03-11.Kyriaki-Kalimeri_Seminar/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2020-03-11.Kyriaki-Kalimeri_Seminar","crumbLabel":"2020-03-11.Kyriaki-Kalimeri_Seminar"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
