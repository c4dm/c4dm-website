We plan to keep talks to about 10 minutes each, depending on the number of submissions.</p>\n<p>POSTERS can be on any research topic of interest to the members of the network. Posters will be displayed on the venue hall during coffees and lunch break.</p>\n<p>The abstracts of presentations will be collated into a digest and distributed on the day.</p>\n<p><b>Submission</b></p>\n<p>Please prepare your talk or poster proposal in the form of an abstract (1 page A4, using the template available from the DMRN+17 web page).
