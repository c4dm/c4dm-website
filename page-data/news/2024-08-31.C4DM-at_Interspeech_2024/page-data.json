Interspeech is the premier international conference for research on the science and technology of spoken language processing.</p>\n<p>C4DM PhD student Chin-Yun Yu will present his paper with C4DM academic Dr George Fazekas  \"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05128\">Differentiable Time-Varying Linear Prediction in the Context of End-to-End Analysis-by-Synthesis</a>\". The paper introduces improvements to the GOLF voice synthesizer, by implementing a joint filtering approach for noise and harmonics using a single LP (Linear Prediction) filter, resembling a classic source-filter model, and replacing frame-wise approximation with sample-by-sample LP processing, implemented efficiently in C++ and CUDA. These modifications result in smoother spectral envelopes, reduced artefacts, and improved performance in listening tests compared to other baselines.

The paper describes the development of a computational framework for automatically detecting and analysing vocalizations of one-day-old chicks (Gallus gallus). Various clustering techniques are used to explore whether chick calls can be categorised into distinct types or if they exist on a continuous spectrum, aiming to provide a more systematic and unbiased approach to understanding chick vocal behaviour compared to previous studies.</p>\n<p>C4DM PhD student Farida Yusuf is part of the programme committee for the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/yfrsw-2024\">Young Female Researchers in Speech Workshop (YFRSW)</a>. The workshop is designed for Bachelor’s and Master’s students currently engaged in speech science and technology research, aiming to promote interest in the field among those who haven’t yet committed to pursuing a PhD. It features panel discussions, student poster presentations, and mentoring sessions, providing participants with opportunities to showcase their research and engage with PhD students and senior researchers in the field.</p>\n<p>See you at Interspeech!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM at Interspeech 2024","date":"Saturday, 31 August 2024","author":"Christos Plachouras","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8c174aab3a9d4d0c7f6f5b3f49e4192b/630bb/Interspeech-2024.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8c174aab3a9d4d0c7f6f5b3f49e4192b/3a8a9/Interspeech-2024.jpg 102w,\n/static/8c174aab3a9d4d0c7f6f5b3f49e4192b/0e8e0/Interspeech-2024.jpg 203w,\n/static/8c174aab3a9d4d0c7f6f5b3f49e4192b/630bb/Interspeech-2024.jpg 406w","sizes":"(min-width: 406px) 406px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/8c174aab3a9d4d0c7f6f5b3f49e4192b/2f521/Interspeech-2024.webp 102w,\n/static/8c174aab3a9d4d0c7f6f5b3f49e4192b/d9e51/Interspeech-2024.webp 203w,\n/static/8c174aab3a9d4d0c7f6f5b3f49e4192b/3b5c6/Interspeech-2024.webp 406w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 406px) 406px, 100vw"}]},"width":406,"height":123}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2024-08-31.C4DM-at_Interspeech_2024","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2024-08-31.C4DM-at_Interspeech_2024/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2024-08-31.C4DM-at_Interspeech_2024","crumbLabel":"2024-08-31.C4DM-at_Interspeech_2024"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
