But we are inching ever closer to\nthe point at which specifying a probability distribution over an audio\nsignal will be practical and useful. In signal processing we are interested in\nmodelling functions of time, and Gaussian processes offer a principled way\nto specify distributions over functions whilst also encoding prior knowledge.\nIn this seminar Iâ€™ll demonstrate how Gaussian processes provide a\nmeans through which to interpret existing models for time-frequency analysis,\nand to construct new models. The probabilistic framework allows us\nto adapt our time-frequency representation to a signal, quantify uncertainty\nabout predictions, and generate new audio signals from the learnt\ndistribution that maintain the correct amplitude and phase relationship.</p>\n<p><b>Author info</b>:\nWill Wilkinson is a PhD student in the Machine Listening Lab at the Centre for Digital Music, QMUL.\nHe is interested in probabilistic models for natural sounds. <a href=\"http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/audioengineering/wil_j_wil/\">See Will's research page for more about his work</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM / Machine Listening Seminar : Will Wilkinson","date":"Tuesday, 4 December 2018","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2018-12-04.Will-Wilkinson_Seminar_Probabilistic_models_for_audio_signals","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2018-12-04.Will-Wilkinson_Seminar_Probabilistic_models_for_audio_signals/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2018-12-04.Will-Wilkinson_Seminar_Probabilistic_models_for_audio_signals","crumbLabel":"2018-12-04.Will-Wilkinson_Seminar_Probabilistic_models_for_audio_signals"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
