Congratulations to Yinghao on this well-deserved recognition, it’s an honor to support such incredibly talented students.”</p>\n<p>Yinghao's PhD research focuses on advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for music understanding and generation. Specifically, he studies how multimodal models can integrate audio, symbolic, and textual information to understand, reason about, and generate music.</p>\n<p>Together with colleagues, he developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00107\">MERT</a>, a large-scale music audio representation model which has more than 10k monthly download in the past three years. His recent work includes developing music instruction-following datasets and benchmarks that help evaluate how well AI systems can comprehend and create music.</p>\n<p>He said: \"It's my great honour to receive the Google PhD Fellowship that recognises my research and strongly contribute to my future career. I’m deeply grateful to Google and QMUL for the support, providing good platforms for AI &#x26; music research.\"</p>\n<p>Congratulations Yinghao!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM PhD student awarded Google PhD Fellowship","date":"Thursday, 23 October 2025","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4ac60065bd12d76e2e9830ee1a3f805a/a89ca/yinghao.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4ac60065bd12d76e2e9830ee1a3f805a/96deb/yinghao.jpg 150w,\n/static/4ac60065bd12d76e2e9830ee1a3f805a/0fdf4/yinghao.jpg 300w,\n/static/4ac60065bd12d76e2e9830ee1a3f805a/a89ca/yinghao.jpg 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/4ac60065bd12d76e2e9830ee1a3f805a/c65bc/yinghao.webp 150w,\n/static/4ac60065bd12d76e2e9830ee1a3f805a/078c3/yinghao.webp 300w,\n/static/4ac60065bd12d76e2e9830ee1a3f805a/6d09e/yinghao.webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":600}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2025-10-23.C4DM-student-awarded-Google-PhD-fellowship","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2025-10-23.C4DM-student-awarded-Google-PhD-fellowship/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2025-10-23.C4DM-student-awarded-Google-PhD-fellowship","crumbLabel":"2025-10-23.C4DM-student-awarded-Google-PhD-fellowship"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
