Yet, in order to adapt these\narchitectures to audio classification tasks, it rarely suffices to\nreplace 2-d convolutions over the spatial coordinates of the image by\n1-d convolutions over the temporal axis of the raw waveform. Instead,\nmost convnets for automatic speech recognition (ASR), as well as\ndetection and classification of acoustic scenes and events (DCASE), are\ntrained on a 2-d representation of acoustic energy in the\ntime-frequency, such as the pointwise logarithm of mel-frequency\nspectrogram (logmelspec). Such an association between logmelspec and\nconvnet is progressively becoming the default baseline in bioacoustic\nclassification, as once were MFCC-GMM-HMM pipelines. However, music\ninformation retrieval (MIR) has not benefited from the same steady\nprogress: in long-lasting challenges such as automatic chord recognition\nor musical instrument classification, logmelspec-convnets only perform\nmarginally better than shallower architectures, even in the large data\nregime.\nIn this talk, I will argue that a major obstacle to the applicability of\nconvnets in MIR, above the lack of large-scale annotated datasets, is\nthe inadequacy of 2-d spectrotemporal receptive fields for modeling some\nof the essential attributes of music perception: pitch, harmony, tempo,\nand meter. In particular, octave equivalence -- that is, the cognitive\nwrapping of a continuous frequency axis onto a spiral which makes a full\nturn at every octave  -- is too often addressed merely as a spurious\nfactor of intra-class in music signal analysis, rather than a resource\nfor improving sparsity and reducing statistical overfitting in learned\nrepresentations.\nAfter reviewing some of the most compelling arguments in favor of octave\nequivalence (from music theory, ethnomusicology, auditory neuroscience,\nand unsupervised learning), I will address the question of building\nconvolutional operators in the time-frequency domain that disentangle\ntemporal variations in pitch chroma from variations in pitch height.\nspiral scattering transform (Lostanlen, DAF-x 2015) and spiral\nconvolutional networks (Lostanlen, DAF-x 2016). While the former enjoys\na better theoretical interpretability, in terms of linearization of\nvelocity parameters in the harmonic source-filter model, the latter can\nbe readily integrated into an end-to-end learning pipeline for\nmultipitch estimation in polyphonic music signals. Then, I will discuss\nfuture research directions, at the intersection of graph signal\nprocessing and the neo-Riemannian music theory: diagonalizing the\nLaplacian operator of the Tonnetz graph yields a basis of so-called\n\"eigenprogressions\" (Lostanlen, ISMIR-LBD 2018), i.e. Fourier-like atoms\nin the chord space of major and minor triads that are informative of\nharmonic similarity while being invariant to musical key, thus leading\nto state-of-the-art results in a task of supervised composer recognition\nfrom symbolic music data.cot2017/).\nHis most recent projects involve the design and evaluation of systems to support 1) therapeutic gait training\nusing Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS), 2) auditory training and second language learning.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Vincent Lostanlen","date":"Sunday, 17 December 2017","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f4be1/placeholder.png 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/b444b/placeholder.png 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/ba986/placeholder.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9b21f/placeholder.webp 300w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/9ff6b/placeholder.webp 600w,\n/static/6e45d55cd3da3f0a9c12568e44160cff/f2559/placeholder.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2018-09-17.VincentLostanlenSeminar","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2018-09-17.VincentLostanlenSeminar/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2018-09-17.VincentLostanlenSeminar","crumbLabel":"2018-09-17.VincentLostanlenSeminar"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
