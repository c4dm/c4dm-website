It brought together over 100 leading minds from across the UKâ€™s mathematical, algorithmic and computational communities to advance the application of pure mathematics in AI. It formed a key element of an exciting programme that aims to unite and revolutionise the mathematical field to unlock new and improved AI systems.</p>\n<p>At the conference, C4DM Director <a href=\"https://www.qmul.ac.uk/eecs/people/profiles/sandlermark.html\">Prof. Mark Sandler</a> presented \"The Case for Artificial Neuroscience: Holistic Rigour for Understanding and Engineering Better Deep Learning\". The talk is linked with Prof. Sandler's ongoing project funded by the EPSRC entitled <a href=\"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FZ535448%2F1\">Artificial Neuroscience: metrology and engineering for Deep Learning using Linear Algebra</a>.</p>\n<p>The EPSRC-funded Erlangen AI Hub exists to revolutionise the application of pure mathematics to understand AI, unifying and expanding the field to unlock new, more intelligent systems - more information on the hub can be found at <a href=\"https://erlangenhub.ox.ac.uk/\">https://erlangenhub.ox.ac.uk/</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mark Sandler presents at Erlangen AI Hub Conference","date":"Thursday, 12 June 2025","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#585858","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9eef75c01631f1a2caf17509f71a027f/77859/Sandler-Erlangen.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9eef75c01631f1a2caf17509f71a027f/9f4ec/Sandler-Erlangen.jpg 384w,\n/static/9eef75c01631f1a2caf17509f71a027f/3b4fe/Sandler-Erlangen.jpg 768w,\n/static/9eef75c01631f1a2caf17509f71a027f/77859/Sandler-Erlangen.jpg 1536w","sizes":"(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9eef75c01631f1a2caf17509f71a027f/56bb2/Sandler-Erlangen.webp 384w,\n/static/9eef75c01631f1a2caf17509f71a027f/9f5d6/Sandler-Erlangen.webp 768w,\n/static/9eef75c01631f1a2caf17509f71a027f/e4a40/Sandler-Erlangen.webp 1536w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, 100vw"}]},"width":1536,"height":2048}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2025-06-12.Mark-Sandler_presents_at_Erlangen_AI_Hub_Conference","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2025-06-12.Mark-Sandler_presents_at_Erlangen_AI_Hub_Conference/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2025-06-12.Mark-Sandler_presents_at_Erlangen_AI_Hub_Conference","crumbLabel":"2025-06-12.Mark-Sandler_presents_at_Erlangen_AI_Hub_Conference"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
