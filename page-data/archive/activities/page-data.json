DAFx grew from a very successful COST action in Europe and has established a reputation for the excellence of the papers and its open, friendly atmosphere. The 2003 edition hosted nearly 150 delegates, and included more than 80 presentations.</p>\n<p>In 2005 we will co-host, with City University, the 6th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR'05).</p>\n<h3>Projects</h3>\n<p>Throughout our history we have successfully participated on a number of projects with industrial and academic partners across the world including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.dafx.de/\">EU COST-G6 action on Digital Audio Effects</a></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.omras.org/\">Online Music Recognition and Searching</a> project</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently we are part of the <a href=\"http://www.semanticaudio.org/\">Semantic Interaction with Music Audio Contents - SIMAC</a> project, funded by the European Commission, and including other highly reputed institutions in Europe. SIMAC's main task is the development of prototypes for the automatic generation, visualisation, retrieval and organisation of music collections, based on the use of semantic descriptors.</p>\n<p>Other new and active projects include EPSRC-funded grants on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../research/projects/epsrc_grr54620_music_trans.html\">Automatic Transcription using ICA models</a></li>\n<li>Semantic segmentation of music</li>\n<li>Object-based audio coding</li>\n<li>Source separation</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Centre for Digital Music: Activities","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/archive/activities","breadcrumb":{"location":"/archive/activities/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/archive","crumbLabel":"archive"},{"pathname":"/archive/activities","crumbLabel":"activities"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
