We have also investigated the application of ICA and other neural network techniques to musical audio analysis (Abdallah, 1998; Abdallah &#x26; Plumbley, 1999) including musical instrument separation (Klingseisen &#x26; Plumbley, 2000), basis construction (Abdallah &#x26; Plumbley, 2001), automatic music transcription (Abdallah &#x26; Plumbley, 2003a) and transient detection (Abdallah &#x26; Plumbley, 2003b).</p>\n<h2>Audio Source Separation</h2>\n<p>We are particularly concerned with the problem of separating sound objects in real room environments. In recent work, we have modelled real room recordings as convolutive mixtures of the auditory objects, separated using a novel Fast Frequency Domain ICA framework. To solve the so-called permutation problem (which in frequency domain approaches can lead to unwanted permutation of sources between frequency bands) we introduced a robust Likelihood Ratio Jump solution. We also studied the ideas of exploiting the extra geometrical information, such as the microphone spacing, and of intelligent source separation of a desired source (Mitianoudis and Davies, 2003a;b;c). In a new EPRSC-funded project we are investigating blind source separation of speech and audio to deal with real acoustic environments, using methods inspired by human hearing.</p>\n<h2>Musical Audio Analysis</h2>\n<p>We have used ICA and its generalisations to noisy and/or non-negative data (such as sparse coding) as a novel approach to automatic music transcription. These rely on musical notes being “more independent” and “more sparse” than audio spectra, removing the need for separate learning of a dictionary of note spectra (Abdallah &#x26; Plumbley 2004b). It has also resulted in a novel approach to event detection based on assessing the \"surprisingness\" of a signal using an ICA-based model of expectation, after which the characteristic shapes of events are learned and detected by a hidden Markov model (HMM) (Abdallah &#x26; Plumbley, 2003c).</p>\n<h2>Networking and Events</h2>\n<p>We coordinate the UK <a href=\"http://www.icarn.org/\">ICA Research Network</a> (<a href=\"http://www.icarn.org/\">www.icarn.org</a>), an EPSRC-funded Network with over 40 UK researchers from over 25 institutions. We hosted its <a href=\"http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/ica/events/launch/\">launch event</a> in April 2005 attracting around 65 people, as well as a previous one-day <a href=\"http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk/ica/\">ICA workshop in December 2002</a>, attended by around 60 delegates.</p>\n<p>In 2007 we hosted <a href=\"http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk/ica2007/\">ICA 2007</a>, the 7th International Conference on Independent Component Analysis and Signal Separation, attracting over 150 delegates to Queen Mary.</p>\n<h2>Academic Staff</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~markp/\">Dr Mark Plumbley</a></strong> has been working in source separation and independent component analysis (ICA) for 5 years, following a background in neural networks since 1987, including the particular method of non-negative ICA. Dr Plumbley has applied ICA and related models to the analysis of music, including automatic music transcription. In 2002 Dr Plumbley visited the ICA group at Helsinki University of Technology on a 3-month Leverhulme Trust Study Abroad Fellowship, and will be giving an invited keynote talk at the forthcoming ICA 2004 conference in Granada, Spain. Recent EPSRC Funding includes: Automatic Polyphonic Music Transcription Using Multiple Cause Models and Independent Component Analysis (GR/R54620/01); Object-based Coding of Musical Audio (GR/S75802/01). Dr Plumbley was Deputy Director of the EC-funded NEuroNet Network of Excellence in Neural Networks (1994-2000), and currently coordinates the EPSRC Digital Music Research Network (GR/R64810/01).</p>\n<h2>Publications</h2>\n<p>S.
