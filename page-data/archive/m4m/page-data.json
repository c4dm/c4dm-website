These have the potential to change the landscape for music (and indeed other media types) in all areas from creation to consumption. By changing how users interact with music, this project shed light on new business models for the music industry.</p>\n<p><strong>Publications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://ismir2011.ismir.net/papers/OS5-3.pdf\">MIR in School?

But how do these two relate to each other, and to the information that can be analysed and visualised using digital music technologies?</p>\n<p>We undertook ethnographic observation of secondary school music classes, to illuminate these issues for the music informatics research community, and to drive technical developments targeted at music education.</p>\n<p>The British Library</p>\n<p>The British Library (BL) has a catalogue of 3.5 million sound recordings, approximately half of which are in a digital format, including many unique historic items, which visitors can listen to in the Library's Reading Rooms while taking notes with paper and pencil. No tools are provided in the Reading Rooms, and the data can not be taken off site due to copyright regulations. The current situation hinders contemporary research, which aims to complement listeners' impressions with precise measurements of musical features. User feedback regarding deployment of analysis and visualisation tools at the BL, undertaken as a preliminary study, indicated the potential to transform musicology research.</p>\n<p>We undertook ethnographic observation of users of the BL's audio material, and worked with the BL on technical developments.</p>\n<h2>Researchers</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~simond/\">Dr Simon Dixon</a> - Principal Investigator<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/people/view/3114/prof-mark-sandler/\">Prof Mark Sandler</a> - Co-investigator<br>\n<a href=\"/people/mathieub.htm\">Dr Mathieu Barthet</a> - Research Assistant<br>\n<a href=\"/people/dans.htm\">Dr Dan Stowell</a> - Research Assistant</p>\n<h2>Sponsor</h2>\n<p>EPSRC Grant <a href=\"http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?Grant=EP/I001832/1\">EP/I001832/1</a>: £250,102, 13 September 2010 – 12 March 2012</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Musicology for the Masses","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/archive/m4m","breadcrumb":{"location":"/archive/m4m/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/archive","crumbLabel":"archive"},{"pathname":"/archive/m4m","crumbLabel":"m4m"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["537410583"],"slicesMap":{}}
