title: "Get Involved"
---

We are always keen for motivated people to come and work with us. There are several ways to get involved, from studying for a PhD or MSc to academic and postdoctoral job opportunities. We are also in continuous collaboration with industry, NGOs, and academic and public sector partners. We enjoy collaborations with research groups and departments across Queen Mary, including [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), [Advanced Robotics](https://www.robotics.qmul.ac.uk/), [Drama](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sed/drama/), and [Intelligent Sensing](https://cis.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/). We are located in Mile End in East London, with excellent transport links and an active campus.

## Study for an MSc in Sound and Music Computing (SMC) 

The Centre for Digital Music is strongly involved in developing and running QMUL’s Master of Science in Sound and Music Computing programme. The MSc allows you to become an expert in sound and music computing by developing new tools or products, like audio processors or instruments, and contribute to the expanding music and media technology sector. Prepare for your career by merging your interest in music with technology and align your passion for music with technology through two specialised streams:  

- <b>AI and Music Data Science stream</b>, focusing on music distribution and data analytics;
- <b>Audio and Music Engineering stream</b>, dedicated to crafting innovative music hardware and more.
