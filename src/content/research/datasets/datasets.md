Shared data enable researchers to reliably compare their results with others. C4DM has a tradition of providing ground truth data for research.


Our [C4DM Zenodo community page](https://zenodo.org/communities/c4dm/) hosts public datasets created as part of our research.

The [C4DM Research Data Repository](https://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/rdr/) hosts datasets created between 2010-2015.

Several C4DM datasets are also available on [isophonics.org](http://isophonics.org/).
