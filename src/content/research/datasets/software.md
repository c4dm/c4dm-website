The most widely-used software tools from C4DM are [Sonic Visualiser](https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/), [aubio](https://aubio.org/), and [Tony](https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/tony).

A large part of our research is converted into [Vamp plugins](https://www.vamp-plugins.org/download.html), which are compatible with Sonic Visualiser and Audacity across several operating systems.

Other C4DM software is available on [isophonics.org](http://isophonics.org/).
 <!-- and our previous [download page](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/downloads/). -->

We also run the [SoundSoftware code repository](https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/) which hosts software projects for audio and music researchers.

Finally, we maintain a [C4DM group in GitHub](https://github.com/c4dm/), hosting public-facing code releases from the group.
