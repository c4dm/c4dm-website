Research workshop, QMUL, London  
Wed 17th February 2016, 9:30am-5pm  
  
The aim of this workshop is to bring together cognitive scientists, neuroscientists and computer scientists working on sound and music, as well as researchers from related fields. New insights on the cognitive and neural underpinnings of speech, music and sound processing will be presented, with a large focus on EEG and MEG data analysis. We anticipate this workshop to be a great opportunity for researchers to get a deeper understanding of available research methods and to foster multidisciplinary collaborations.
