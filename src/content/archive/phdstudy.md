The Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London is a world-leading research group in the field of Music & Audio Technology. Our research covers everything in digital music and audio: from analysis, understanding and retrieval to delivery, synthesis and sound rendering. We seek not only to investigate new applications of digital signal processing (DSP), but also to push forward the frontiers of DSP itself.

PhD researchers are currently sought in [a range of topics](ProposedPhDTopics.html) including:

*   Audio Engineering
    *   [Semantic Audio Systems for Studio and Live Sound applications](ProposedPhDTopics.html#semanticlivesound)
    *   [Intelligent Mixing of Live Multichannel Sound](ProposedPhDTopics.html#mixing)
    *   [Development of Interchannel Dependent Audio Effects](ProposedPhDTopics.html#effects)
    *   [Acoustic autofocus](ProposedPhDTopics.html#autofocus)
*   Interactional Sound and Music
    *   [Evaluating Mutual Engagement through New Musical Interfaces](ProposedPhDTopics.html#evalengagement)
    *   [Multimodal Location Based Techniques for Extreme Navigation and sports training](ProposedPhDTopics.html#extremenav)
*   Machine Listening
    *   [Intelligent Instrument Recognition](ProposedPhDTopics.html#instrument)
    *   [Making Sense of Sounds: Towards Intelligent Machine Listening](ProposedPhDTopics.html#makingsense)
*   Music Informatics
    *   [Music Informatics for On-line Music Recommendation Systems](ProposedPhDTopics.html#musicrec)
    *   [Automatic transcription from audio to common music notation](ProposedPhDTopics.html#transcription)

 _![PhD researchers in the Listening Room](images/LR_web_res/andrewdan_IMG_3955_0233.jpg) Applications are also invited for PhD research study in any of our areas of interest._ Possible topic areas might include: automatic music transcription; harmony analysis; auditory scene analysis; beat tracking & rhythm analysis; blind source separation & independent component analysis (ICA); joint audio/video tracking and transcription; A/D & D/A conversion; ![PhD researcher Becky Stewart](images/dsc_9042a.jpg) sigma delta modulation; scalable audio codecs; object based coding; sparse representations & sparse coding; music information retrieval; semantic markup, musical metadata & MPEG7 applications; audio effects; 3D sound & multi-loudspeaker rendering systems; intelligent microphone arrays; automatic accompaniment; interactive performance/internet jamming; interactive compositional tools; biologically inspired audio processing; and pervasive audio ("my music wherever I am"). We have recently invested £300k in a new state-of-the-art audio listening facility, and we are keen to encourage at least one project in the area of 3D sound which would be allied to this new facility.

## Funding

The Centre for Digital Music is part of the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, which has a number of EPSRC-funded Research Studentships that cover fees and maintenance for UK students, or fees-only for EU students. Additional studentships are often available There is always strong competition for Research Studentships, so early application is recommended. Applications are also welcomed from self-funded students.

## Application

Applicants should follow the guidelines that can be found at [http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/phd/apply.php](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/phd/apply.php)
