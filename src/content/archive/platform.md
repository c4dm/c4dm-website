EPSRC Grant EP/E045235/1, £1.2m fEC, £1,057,355 to Queen Mary, 2007-2012

The aim of this "Platform Grant" s to maintain and strengthen the Centre for Digital Music as a world-leading research group, through the provision of background funding to provide stability and flexibility in our recruitment of key research staff.

The specific objectives are:  
i) To retain key RAs through gap-bridging funding between regular research grants;  
ii) To retain key graduating PhD students as named CI/RAs, during the time taken to secure their intended funding;  
iii) To maximize the impact and exploitation of our research, through the provision of software tools and public engagement events;  
iv) To undertake adventurous interdisciplinary projects, through short feasibility studies or proofs of concept before full proposals are submitted.

The Platform Grant also includes an internship & outreach scheme.
