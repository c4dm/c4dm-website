## Activities

### Networking

We currently coordinate the UK [Digital Music Research Network](http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk/dmrn/), an initiative funded by EPSRC (The UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council), aiming to enhance UK research in the Musical Signal Processing community through improved communication and collaboration between the members of this community and related groups both in the UK and abroad.

We also coordinate the [AES Technical Committee on Semantic Audio Analysis](http://www.aes.org/technical/saa/), concerned with providing a forum within the AES for researchers and innovators interested on the automatic extraction of meaning from audio.

### Conferences and events

In 2003 we were hosts to the [6th International Conference on Digital Audio Effects (DAFx03)](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/dafx03/). DAFx grew from a very successful COST action in Europe and has established a reputation for the excellence of the papers and its open, friendly atmosphere. The 2003 edition hosted nearly 150 delegates, and included more than 80 presentations.

In 2005 we will co-host, with City University, the 6th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR'05).

### Projects

Throughout our history we have successfully participated on a number of projects with industrial and academic partners across the world including:

- The [EU COST-G6 action on Digital Audio Effects](http://www.dafx.de/)
- The [Online Music Recognition and Searching](http://www.omras.org/) project

Currently we are part of the [Semantic Interaction with Music Audio Contents - SIMAC](http://www.semanticaudio.org/) project, funded by the European Commission, and including other highly reputed institutions in Europe. SIMAC's main task is the development of prototypes for the automatic generation, visualisation, retrieval and organisation of music collections, based on the use of semantic descriptors.

Other new and active projects include EPSRC-funded grants on:

- [Automatic Transcription using ICA models](../research/projects/epsrc_grr54620_music_trans.html)
- Semantic segmentation of music
- Object-based audio coding
- Source separation
