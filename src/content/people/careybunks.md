blurb: "Most people are familiar with Shazam, the app that recognizes recorded music using audio fingerprinting.  It provides the title, artist, and other information from the audio of a song, as provided by the publisher.  Shazam does not, however, work for live music.  The topic of this thesis is song title recognition from live jazz."
