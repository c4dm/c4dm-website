   abstract = {In recent years, source separation has been a central research topic in music signal processing, with applications in stereo-to-surround up-mixing, remixing tools for disc jockeys or producers, instrument-wise equalizing, karaoke systems, and preprocessing in music analysis tasks. Musical sound sources, however, are often strongly correlated in time and frequency, and without additional knowledge about the sources, a decomposition of a musical recording is often infeasible. To simplify this complex task, various methods have recently been proposed that exploit the availability of a musical score. The additional instrumentation and note information provided by the score guides the separation process, leading to significant improvements in terms of separation quality and robustness. A major challenge in utilizing this rich source of information is to bridge the gap between high-level musical events specified by the score and their corresponding acoustic realizations in an audio recording. In this article, we review recent developments in score-informed source separation and discuss various strategies for integrating the prior knowledge encoded by the score},

   abstract = {Automatic species classification of birds from their sound is a computational tool of increasing importance in ecology, conservation monitoring and vocal communication studies. To make classification useful in practice, it is crucial to improve its accuracy while ensuring that it can run at big data scales. Many approaches use acoustic measures based on spectrogram-type data, such as the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features which represent a manually-designed summary of spectral information. However, recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that features learnt automatically from data can often outperform manually-designed feature transforms. Feature learning can be performed at large scale and “unsupervised”, meaning it requires no manual data labelling, yet it can improve performance on “supervised” tasks such as classification. In this work we introduce a technique for feature learning from large volumes of bird sound recordings, inspired by techniques that have proven useful in other domains. We experimentally compare twelve different feature representations derived from the Mel spectrum (of which six use this technique), using four large and diverse databases of bird vocalisations, classified using a random forest classifier. We demonstrate that in our classification tasks, MFCCs can often lead to worse performance than the raw Mel spectral data from which they are derived. Conversely, we demonstrate that unsupervised feature learning provides a substantial boost over MFCCs and Mel spectra without adding computational complexity after the model has been trained. The boost is particularly notable for single-label classification tasks at large scale. The spectro-temporal activations learned through our procedure resemble spectro-temporal receptive fields calculated from avian primary auditory forebrain. However, for one of our datasets, which contains substantial audio data but few annotations, increased performance is not discernible. We study the interaction between dataset characteristics and choice of feature representation through further empirical analysis.},

   abstract = {Birdsong often contains large amounts of rapid frequency modulation (FM). It is believed that the use or otherwise of FM is adaptive to the acoustic environment and also that there are specific social uses of FM such as trills in aggressive territorial encounters. Yet temporal fine detail of FM is often absent or obscured in standard audio signal analysis methods such as Fourier analysis or linear prediction. Hence, it is important to consider high-resolution signal processing techniques for analysis of FM in bird vocalizations. If such methods can be applied at big data scales, this offers a further advantage as large data sets become available.
We introduce methods from the signal processing literature which can go beyond spectrogram representations to analyse the fine modulations present in a signal at very short time-scales. Focusing primarily on the genus Phylloscopus, we investigate which of a set of four analysis methods most strongly captures the species signal encoded in birdsong. We evaluate this through a feature selection technique and an automatic classification experiment. In order to find tools useful in practical analysis of large data bases, we also study the computational time taken by the methods, and their robustness to additive noise and MP3 compression.
We find three methods which can robustly represent species-correlated FM attributes and can be applied to large data sets, and that the simplest method tested also appears to perform the best. We find that features representing the extremes of FM encode species identity supplementary to that captured in frequency features, whereas bandwidth features do not encode additional information.
FM analysis can extract information useful for bioacoustic studies, in addition to measures more commonly used to characterize vocalizations. Further, it can be applied efficiently across very large data sets and archives.},
