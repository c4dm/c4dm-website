C4DM researchers have had a lot of success this year in being accepted for [ICASSP 2018](https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/),
the IEEE's International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing. 
Most of these papers are led by C4DM PhD students, on MIR and Machine Listening topics:

by Bhusan Chettri and Bob L. Sturm

* "Towards Complete Polyphonic Music Transcription: Integrating Multi-Pitch Detection and Rhythm Quantization"
by Eita Nakamura, Emmanouil Benetos, Kazuyoshi Yoshii, and Simon Dixon

* "Polyphonic Music Sequence Transduction With Meter-Constrained LSTM Networks"
by Adrien Ycart and Emmanouil Benetos

* "Feature Design Using Audio Decomposition for Intelligent Control of the Dynamic Range Compressor"
by Di Sheng and GyoÌˆrgy Fazekas

* "Adversarial Semi-Supervised Audio Source Separation applied to Singing Voice Extraction"
[[preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00048)]
by Daniel Stoller, Sebastian Ewert, Simon Dixon

* "Similarity Measures For Vocal-Based Drum Sample Retrieval Using Deep Convolutional Auto-Encoders"
[[preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05178)] by Adib Mehrabi, Kuenwoo Choi, Simon Dixon, Mark B. Sandler

* "Shift-Invariant Kernel Additive Modelling for Audio Source Separation"
[[preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00351)]
