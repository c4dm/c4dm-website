The Digital Audio Effects (DAFx) conference was held from 2nd to 5th September 2025 at the historic Mole Vanvitelliana in Ancona, Italy. DAFx is a leading international conference dedicated to the exploration of digital audio effects, signal processing, and related technologies.

Day one consisted of a series of tutorials, covering topics such as non-iterative numerical simulation, filter design with logarithmic frequency resolution, to differentiable pipelines for feedback delay networks and acoustic environment editation.
The remaining days featured a rich technical program, including oral and poster presentations, interesting demos, and keynote talks from renowned researchers in the field.
The banquet on the second day was located at the other side of city, in the beautiful setting of the MaWay restaurant, overlooking the Adriatic Sea, featuring amazing seafood and risotto dishes.
The next day concluded with an amazing electronic sound and video performance at the conference venue, featuring a selection of Italian vintage synthesisers.

This time C4DM had three technical papers accepted at DAFx 2025, focusing on the theme of **differentiable systems** in different paradigms and applications.

The first paper, titled [Fast Differentiable Modal Simulation of Non-Linear Strings, Membranes, and Plates](https://www.dafx.de/paper-archive/2025/DAFx25_paper_35.pdf), was presented by PhD student Rodrigo Diaz.
This work develop GPU-accelerated and differentiable implementations for physical modelling of musical instruments, focusing on modal synthesis of strings, membranes, and plates with non-linear effects.
The resulting implementations in JAX can be accessed [here](https://github.com/rodrigodzf/jaxdiffmodal).
This work makes differentiable simulations easy to use, effectively bridging
classical modal techniques with modern automatic differentiation methods.

The second paper, titled [Differentiable Attenuation Filters for Feedback Delay Networks](https://www.dafx.de/paper-archive/2025/DAFx25_paper_54.pdf), was presented by PhD student Ilias Ibnyahya.
This work focus on designing the attenutation filters used in feedback loop of feedback delay networks (FDNs) for artificial reverberation.
Cascaded second-order sections are used and shared across all delay lines, reducing the number of parameters needed.
The proposed design is differentiable, allowing for end-to-end optimisation of the FDN parameters using gradient-based methods.
