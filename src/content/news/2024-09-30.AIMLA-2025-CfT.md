The [AES International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Audio (AIMLA 2025)](https://aes2.org/contributions/2025-1st-aes-international-conference-on-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-for-audio-call-for-contributions/), hosted at the [Centre for Digital Music](https://www.c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) of Queen Mary University of London and taking place on Sept. 8-10, 2025 is calling for <b>Tutorial</b> submissions.

We are seeking proposals for 120-minute hands-on tutorials on the conference topics. The proposal should include a title, an abstract (60-120 words), a list of topics, and a description (up to 500 words). Additionally, the submission should include presentersâ€™ names, qualifications, and technical requirements (sound requirements during the presentation, such as stereo, multichannel, etc.). We encourage tutorials to be supported by an elaborate collation of discussed content and code to support learning and building resources for a given topic.
