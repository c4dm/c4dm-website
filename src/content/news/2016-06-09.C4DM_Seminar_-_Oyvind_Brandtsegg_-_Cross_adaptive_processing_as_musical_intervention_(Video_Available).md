<span style="font-size: 130%;">Abstract</span></br>
The project explores cross-adaptive processing as a drastic intervention in the modes of communication between performing musicians. Digital audio analysis and processing techniques are used to enable features of one sound to inform the processing of another. This allows the actions of one performer to directly influence another performer’s sound, and doing so only by means of the acoustic signal produced by normal musical expression on the instrument. To enable the cross adaptive processing methods, a number of software tools for this kind of musical performance will be developed. Sessions documentation, reflections, software and other material will be available as posts to the project blog. The project is run by the Norwegian University of Technology and Science, Music Technology, Trondheim. We are proud to collaborate with our strong partners at De Montfort University, Maynooth University, Queen Mary University of London and University of California San Diego. Our project is strongly based in practical experimentation with said techniques, and for this we rely on collaboration with a range of finely selected performers. Project leader is professor Øyvind Brandtsegg.

Øyvind Brandtsegg is a composer and performer working in the fields of algorithmic improvisation and sound installations. His main instrument as a musician is Hadron Particle Synthesizer, ImproSculpt and Marimba Lumina. ImproSculpt is an instrument for live sampling and realtime composition, built by Brandtsegg. Hadron is a very flexible realtime granular synthesizer. In addition to his own work as a composer and musician, he has also done programming for other artists and for commercial audio applications. As musician and composer he has collaborated with a number of excellent artists, e.g. Oslo Sinfonietta, Motorpsycho, Kristin Asbjørnsen, Live Maria Roggen, Trondheim Jazz Orchestra, Trio Alpaca, Tre Små kinesere, Zeena Parkins, Maja Ratkje. In 2008, Brandtsegg finished his PhD equivalent artistic research project, focused on musical improvisation with computers. Øyvind has done lectures and workshops on these themes in USA, Germany, Ireland, and of course in Norway. Since 2010 he is a professor of music technology at NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.
