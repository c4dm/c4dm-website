Today, 28th August 2015, C4DM presented a one day workshop entitled Listening In The Wild, organised by Dan Stowell, Bob Sturm and Emmanouil Benetos.

The morning session presented a range of research including sound event detection using NMF and DTW techniques, understanding detectability variations of species and habitats, animal vocalisation synthesis through probabilistic models.

The post lunch session saw discussion on vocal modelling and analysis working towards understanding how animals produce their given associated sounds. Following this there was further discussion on NMF followed by work on using bird songs as part of a musical composition.

The poster session included work on auditory scene analysis, bird population vocalisation variations, CHiME: a sound source recognition dataset, technology assisted animal population size measures, bird identification through the use of identity vectors, and DTW for bird song dissimilarity.
