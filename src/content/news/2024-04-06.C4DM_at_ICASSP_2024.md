On 14-19 April, several C4DM researchers will participate at the <b>[2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024)](https://2024.ieeeicassp.org/)</b>. ICASSP is the leading conference in the field of signal processing and the flagship event of the [IEEE Signal Processing Society](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/).

As in previous years, the Centre for Digital Music will have a strong presence at the conference, both in terms of numbers and overall impact. The below papers presented at ICASSP 2024 are authored or co-authored by C4DM members:

* [High resolution guitar transcription via domain adaptation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10446182), by Xavier Riley, Drew Edwards, and Simon Dixon

* [Learning from taxonomy: multi-label few-shot classification for everyday sound recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10446908), by Jinhua Liang, Huy Phan, and Emmanouil Benetos

* [Bass accompaniment generation via latent diffusion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10446400), by Marco Pasini, Maarten Grachten, and Stefan Lattner
