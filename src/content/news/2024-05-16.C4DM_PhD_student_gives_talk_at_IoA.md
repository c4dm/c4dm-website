Centre for Digital Music PhD student [Jinhua Liang](https://jinhualiang.github.io/) will be giving a talk on "Machine listening with natural language" as part of the UK's Institute of Acoustics event on [Artificial Intelligence for Acoustics](https://www.ioa.org.uk/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&id=860), taking place on 22 May 2024 at London South Bank University.

Given the recent increase in use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT, there has been much speculation and interest in how AI can be harnessed as a tool across the acoustics industry. However, whilst there are many possibilities for application, there are also many questions still to be answered. Jinhua's work will be showcasing [how large language models (LLMs) can be empowered with audition capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00249) and [how LLMs can support audio editing and generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09527).
