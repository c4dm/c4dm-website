The Creative Audio Synthesis and Interfaces Workshop was held at Queen Mary University of London on July 15th, 2025.
This one-day workshop included a series of talks exploring the intersection of creative audio synthesis and AI-enabled synthesizer programming. 
Topics included evolutionary algorithms for sound exploration, synthesizer sound matching, timbre transfer, timbre-based control, reinforcement learning, differentiable digital signal processing, representation learning, and human-machine co-creativity.

Earlier this year, the AIM CDT visited the [RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time, and Motion](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/) at the University of Oslo in Norway.
A shared interest in creative applications of audio synthesis and novel interface designs was established during this visit, motivating this follow-up workhshop at QMUL.
Researchers from RITMO, The Open University, and the AIM CDT at QMUL were invited to
share their work, engage in critical discussion, and map directions for
future work. See below for a summary of talks with links to presentation recordings.

An evening concert showcased musical applications of technical implementations discussed during the workshop, grounding these discussions in real-world artistic contexts.

The Creative Audio Synthesis and Interfaces Workshop was organised by [COMMA Lab](https://comma.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) members Jordie Shier, Haokun Tian, and Charalampos Saitis, and was supported by the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music ([AIM](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/)) at the Centre for Digital Music ([C4DM](https://www.c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/)).
