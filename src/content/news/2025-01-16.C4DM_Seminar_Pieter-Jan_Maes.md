<b>Title</b>: Embodied music interaction in eXtended Reality with virtual avatars and agents
-----------------

<b>Abstract</b>: In my talk, I will present how eXtended Reality (XR) enhances embodied music interaction, particularly in remote music performance and collaboration with computational agents. At IPEM, we investigate ‘virtual embodiment,’ a concept that extends ‘naturalistic’ embodied music interaction into virtual (social) spaces. I'll present a series of experiments and creative-artistic applications on virtual embodiment in the domain of (remote) music performance, education, and dance.

<b>Bio</b>: My research is situated in the field of systematic musicology, focusing on embodied and social interaction with music. This research requires a cross-over of fundamental music research – including theory formation and experimental research – and music application development.
