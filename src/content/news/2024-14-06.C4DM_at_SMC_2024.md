On 4â€“6th July, several C4DM researchers will participate in the <b>[2024 conference on Sound and Music computing (SMC 2024)](https://smcnetwork.org/smc2024/#programme)</b> in Porto, Portugal. With this years theme being 'immersive', the conference brings together interdisciplinary work from composers, scientists and other researchers tackling engagement with digital sound and music.

The Centre for Digital Music will be present with work ranging from piano transcription to latent audio models. We look forward to sharing the below papers, authored or co-authored by C4DM members:
