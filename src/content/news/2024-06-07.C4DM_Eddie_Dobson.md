<b>Title</b>: A social psychology approach to fostering inclusion in music technology education
-----------------

<b>Abstract</b>: Organised by C4DM/AIM/EECS/WHEN, in this talk Dr Eddie Dobson will address the considerable challenges facing Women and minority gender professionals (WMGP) in the audio industries, which are are serviced by a majority white, cis, able-bodied male workforce. The talk will touch on:

- the hidden curriculum,
- a gender-blind and technology-led understanding of engagement,
- the influence of early years access on engagement,
- a developmental perspective on identity and engagement in music technology,
- how learners are perceived by peers and educators 'confident boys and 'bolshie' girls,
- and the potential benefit of fun, friendship and collaborative play for supporting sustained engagement in MTE so that all learners might flourish.
