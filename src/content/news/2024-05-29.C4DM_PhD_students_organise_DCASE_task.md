Centre for Digital Music PhD students [Ines Nolasco](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C1jftogAAAAJ&hl=en), [Shubhr Singh](https://shubhrsingh22.github.io/), and [Jinhua Liang](https://jinhualiang.github.io/) are organising the task on [Few-shot Bioacoustic Event Detection](https://dcase.community/challenge2024/task-few-shot-bioacoustic-event-detection) as part of the IEEE AASP Challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE 2024).

This task addresses a real need from animal researchers by providing a well-defined, constrained yet highly variable domain to evaluate machine learning methodology. It aims to advance the study of audio signal processing and deep learning in the low-resource scenario, particularly in domain adaptation and few-shot learning. Datasets will be released on 1st June 2024, with the challenge deadline being on 15 June 2024.

Can you build a system that detects an animal sound with only 5 examples?  Let's liaise to push the boundary of computational bioacoustics and machine listening!
