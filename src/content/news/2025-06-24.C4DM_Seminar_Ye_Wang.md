<b>Title</b>: Speech and Music AI: Connecting the Dots of AI and Human Potential
-----------------

<b>Abstract</b>: Speech and music are traditionally studied by different research communities. In this talk, I will share some insights from my journey of connecting the dots of speech, music, AI and neuroscience for real world applications in boosting human health and potential. This decade-long exploration has shaped my signature research – Sound and Music Computing for Human Health and Potential (SMC4HHP).

<b>Bio</b>: Prof. Ye Wang is affiliated with the Computer Science Department at the National University of Singapore (NUS), the NUS Graduate School’s Integrative Sciences and Engineering Programme (ISEP), the Institute of Data Science (IDS), as well as the Institute for Applied Learning Sciences & Educational Technology (ALSET). He established and continues to direct the NUS Sound and Music Computing (SMC) Lab (https://smcnus.comp.nus.edu.sg/). Before joining NUS, he was a member of the technical staff at Nokia Research Center in Tampere, Finland for 9 years. His research sits at the intersection of Sound and Music Computing (SMC) and Human Health and Potential (HHP).
