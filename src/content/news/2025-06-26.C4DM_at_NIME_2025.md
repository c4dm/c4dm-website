On 24-27 June 2025, several C4DM researchers will participate at the <b>[2025 International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME 2025)](https://nime2025.org/)</b>. Once again, this year's edition will have [Bela](https://bela.io/) as an official sponsor.

As in previous years, C4DM will have a strong presence at the conference, both in terms of numbers and overall impact. The below papers authored or co-authored by C4DM members will be presented at the <b>paper track</b>:
