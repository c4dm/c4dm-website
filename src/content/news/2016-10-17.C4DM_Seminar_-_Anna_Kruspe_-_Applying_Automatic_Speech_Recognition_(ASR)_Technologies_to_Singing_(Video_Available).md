<span style="font-size: 130%;">Abstract</span></br>
In the past 15 years, the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) has
produced a multitude of interesting approaches for the analysis of
various characteristics of music. However, one aspect that has not
received much attention so far is the lyrical content of singing voices.
This talk will provide an overview of my work on the application of
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies to singing. I will focus
on three topics:
- Language Identification is the task of detecting the language of a singing recording
- Keyword Spotting is concerned with finding certain keywords in a collection of music
- Lyrics-to-singing alignment provides ways to attach known textual lyrics to singing recordings
I will give short overviews of the state of the art of these topics,
present my own approaches (including two practical demonstrations), and
talk about the current possibilities and limitations in this field of
research.

Anna Kruspe is a researcher and Ph.D. student at Fraunhofer Institute
for Digital Media Technology (IDMT) in Ilmenau, Germany. In addition to
her Ph.D. research on speech recognition for singing, she is currently
working on projects about automatic speech/music discrimination,
recommendation engines, and music classification for various industry
clients.
She received her Master's degree in Media Technology from Ilmenau
Technical University (TU Ilmenau) in 2011. Her final thesis was on the
topic of classification of musical pieces into global cultural areas and
was supervised by Prof. Karlheinz Brandenburg. Prior to this, she worked
on various speech recognition tasks as an intern at Toshiba Research
Europe Ltd.
For her final thesis, Anna Kruspe received the Hugo Geiger Prize of the
Fraunhofer Society. Her Ph.D. work is funded through a scholarship of
the Fraunhofer Society. From 2013 to 2014, she was an exchange
researcher at the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) of
the Johns Hopkins University and was advised by Prof. Hynek Hermansky.
This research stay was funded through a Fulbright scholarship.
