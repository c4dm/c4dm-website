On 12-15 October, several C4DM researchers will participate at the <b>[2025 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics](http://www.waspaa.com/)</b>, taking place at the Granlibakken Tahoe Resort near Lake Tahoe, in Tahoe City, CA, USA. WASPAA is a premier event in the field of audio signal processing, organised by the IEEE's Audio and Acoustic Signal Processing (AASP) technical committee, with a strong focus on music signal processing and computational sound scene analysis.

The Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), as in previous years, will have a strong presence at WASPAA 2025.

In the <b>Technical Programme</b>, the following papers are authored by C4DM members:

* [Latent Acoustic Mapping for Direction of Arrival Estimation: A Self-Supervised Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07066) (Adrian S. Roman, Iran R. Roman, Juan Pablo Bello)
* [RUMAA: Repeat-Aware Unified Music Audio Analysis for Score-Performance Alignment, Transcription, and Mistake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12175) (Sungkyun Chang, Simon Dixon, Emmanouil Benetos)
* [Modulation Discovery with Differentiable Digital Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06204) (Christopher Mitcheltree, Hao Hao Tan, Joshua D. Reiss)
* Beyond Architecture: The Critical Impact of Inference Overlap on Music Source Separation Benchmarks (Harnick Khera, Johan Pauwels, Alan W. Archer-Boyd, Mark B. Sandler)
* [Improving Inference-Time Optimisation for Vocal Effects Style Transfer with a Gaussian Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11315) (Chin-Yun Yu, Marco A. Martínez-Ramírez, Junghyun Koo, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Yuki Mitsufuji, George Fazekas)
* [Self-Supervised Representation Learning with a JEPA Framework for Multi-instrument Music Transcription](https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/109071) (Mary Pilataki, Matthias Mauch, Simon Dixon)

In the <b>Demo Session</b>, the following demos will be presented by C4DM members:

* Neural Audio Synthesis for Non-Keyboard Instruments (Franco Caspe, Andrew McPherson, Mark Sandler)
* PCA-DiffVox: Augmenting Vocal Effects Tweakability With a Bijective Latent Space (Chin-Yun Yu, Marco A. Martínez-Ramírez, Junghyun Koo, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Yuki Mitsufuji, George Fazekas)

See you at WASPAA!
