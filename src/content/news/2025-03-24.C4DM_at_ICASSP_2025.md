On 6-11 April 2025, several C4DM researchers will participate at the <b>[2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025)](https://2025.ieeeicassp.org/)</b>. ICASSP is the leading conference in the field of signal processing and the flagship event of the [IEEE Signal Processing Society](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/).

As in previous years, the Centre for Digital Music will have a strong presence at the conference, both in terms of numbers and overall impact. The below papers authored or co-authored by C4DM members will be presented at the <b>main ICASSP 2025 track</b>:
