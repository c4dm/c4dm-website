The [Erlangen AI Hub Conference](https://erlangenhub.ox.ac.uk/hubs-major-conference-brings-together-leading-minds-at-the-intersection-of-mathematics-and-ai/) took place on 9-11 June 2025 at Queen Mary University of London. It brought together over 100 leading minds from across the UKâ€™s mathematical, algorithmic and computational communities to advance the application of pure mathematics in AI. It formed a key element of our exciting programme that aims to unite and revolutionise the mathematical field to unlock new and improved AI systems.

At the conference, C4DM Director [Prof. Mark Sandler](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/eecs/people/profiles/sandlermark.html) presented "The Case for Artificial Neuroscience: Holistic Rigour for Understanding and Engineering Better Deep Learning". The talk is linked with Prof. Sandler's ongoing project funded by the EPSRC entitled [Artificial Neuroscience: metrology and engineering for Deep Learning using Linear Algebra](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FZ535448%2F1).

The EPSRC-funded Erlangen AI Hub exists to revolutionise the application of pure mathematics to understand AI, unifying and expanding the field to unlock new, more intelligent systems - more information on the hub can be found at [https://erlangenhub.ox.ac.uk/](https://erlangenhub.ox.ac.uk/).
