The Centre for Digital Music will be hosting the second in-person meet-up of the [UK Acoustics Network special interest group on Spatial Acoustics and Immersive Audio (SIG-SAIA)](https://acoustics.ac.uk/sigs/spatial-acoustics-and-immersive-audio/) on the 10th of May, 2024, at Queen Mary University of London. The meetup will be organised by [Dr Aidan Hogg](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/eecs/people/profiles/aidanhogg.html), Lecturer in Computer Science at C4DM and Queen Mary, who is also SIG-SAIA group co-ordinator.

The meetup will feature short talks from researchers working in the group's remit, including C4DM PhD student [Chin-Yun Yu](https://yoyololicon.github.io/) who will give a talk on "Time-of-arrival estimation and phase unwrapping of head-related transfer functions with integer linear programming", and C4DM Post-Doctoral Research Assistant [Saurjya Sarkar](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/eecs/people/profiles/sarkarsaurjya.html) who will give a talk on "Time-domain music source separation for choirs and ensembles". The meetup will conclude with a backstage visit at the Royal Opera House.
