On 30 June - 5 July 2025, C4DM researchers will participate at the <b>[IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025)](https://2025.ijcnn.org/)</b>, the flagship conference of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society and the International Neural Network Society. 

As in previous years, the Centre for Digital Music will have a strong presence at the conference. The following papers authored/co-authored by C4DM members will be presented at IJCNN 2025:

* [ImprovNet - Generating Controllable Musical Improvisations with Iterative Corruption Refinemen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04522), by Keshav Bhandari, Sungkyun Chang, Tongyu Lu, Fareza Rahman Enus, Louis
Bradshaw, Dorien Herremans, Simon Colton

* [Mamba-Diffusion Model with Learnable Wavelet for Controllable Symbolic Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03314), by Jincheng Zhang, George Fazekas, Charalampos Saitis

* [Towards a Unified Representation Evaluation Framework Beyond Downstream Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06224), by Christos Plachouras, Julien Guinot, George Fazekas, Elio Quinton, Emmanouil Benetos, Johan Pauwels


The following presentation from C4DM members will also be made at IJCNN 2025:
