[Chris Cannam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cannam/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BigSsnSezQ9KdnODYvStwOA%3D%3D), Principal Research Software Developer at the Centre for Digital Music at QMUL has just completed a project that involved creating two new Vamp plugins from machine learning models for music audio:

* [MERT Vamp Plugin](https://github.com/cannam/mert-vamp-plugin): a feature extractor for [MERT audio features](https://github.com/yizhilll/MERT)

* [Vamp Lossy Encoding Detector](https://github.com/cannam/vamp-lossy-encoding-detector): detect whether music audio has previously been encoded via lossy compression
