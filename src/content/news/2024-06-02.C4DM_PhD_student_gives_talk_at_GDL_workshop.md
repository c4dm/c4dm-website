Centre for Digital Music PhD student [Shubhr Singh](https://shubhrsingh22.github.io/) will be presenting his recent work on "Local-Higher Order GNNs For Audio Classification And Tagging" as part of the [Geometric Deep Learning workshop](https://maths4dl.ac.uk/newsevents/geometric-deep-learning-workshop-university-of-cambridge-10-12-june-2024), taking place on 10-12 June 2024 at the University of Cambridge. The workshop is organised by the EPSRC's [Mathematics for Deep Learning programme grant (m4DL)](https://maths4dl.ac.uk/).

Shubhr's work introduces the Local-Higher Order Graph Neural Network (LHGNN), which stands as a significant step forward in the field of audio classification and tagging, providing a robust framework that leverages graph-based and clustering methodologies to achieve high performance.
