C4DM spinouts were showcased at an event organised by [Queen Mary Innovation (QMI)](https://qminnovation.co.uk/) which took place on 7 June 2024 - all led by inspiring academic entrepreneurs developing incredible new uses for music, audio, and AI.

[RoEx](https://www.linkedin.com/company/roexaudio/), founded by David Ronan, lets musicians produce professional-level mixes in minutes. By removing barriers, this technology can democratise professional hashtag#music creation, making it accessible and intuitive for all.

[Nemisindo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nemisindo/), founded by Josh Reiss, generates original sound effects in real time, creating sounds which are truly believable - rather than relying on pre-recorded effects which are never quite right.

HITar, founded by [Andrea Martelloni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-martelloni-7ab10a60/), uses real-time embedded AI to provide a rich control surface on an acoustic guitar's body for making drum and synthesiser sounds - giving the artist true freedom of expression. 

[Get in touch with QMI](https://qminnovation.co.uk/contact-us/) and spinout leads to learn more about any of these companies and what else is in the pipeline!
