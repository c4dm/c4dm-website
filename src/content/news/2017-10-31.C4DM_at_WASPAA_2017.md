On 15-18 October 2017 the <b>[2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics](http://www.waspaa.com/)</b> took place in New Paltz, USA. WASPAA is a premier event in the field of audio signal processing, with a strong focus on music signal processing and sound scene analysis.

Queen Mary University of London, and more specifically its Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), had as in previous years a strong presence at WASPAA 2017.

In the <b>Technical Programme</b>, the following papers were authored/coauthored by C4DM members:

* [An Augmented Lagrangian Method for Piano Transcription Using Equal Loudness Thresholding and LSTM-based Decoding](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~ewerts/publications/2017_EwertSandler_PianoTransADMM+LSTM_WASPAA.pdf) (Sebastian Ewert and Mark Sandler)
* [Sound Event Detection in Synthetic Audio: Analysis of the DCASE 2016 Task Results](http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/25293) (Gregoire Lafay, Emmanouil Benetos, and Mathieu Lagrange)
* [Zero-Delay Large Signal Convolution Using Multiple Processor Architectures](http://www.waspaa.com/schedule/#S1569546892) (Nicholas Jillings, Joshua Reiss, and Ryan Stables)

Finally, Dr Sebastian Ewert from C4DM was member of the <b>organizing committee</b> as Awards Chair.
