On 21-25 September 2025, several C4DM researchers will participate at the <b>[26th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2024)](https://ismir2025.ismir.net/)</b>. ISMIR is the leading conference in the field of music informatics, and is currently the [top-cited publication for Music & Musicology](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=hum_musicmusicology) (source: Google Scholar). This year ISMIR will take place onsite in Daejeon, Korea.

Similar to previous years, the Centre for Digital Music will have a strong presence at ISMIR 2025.
