The Smart Instruments and the Internet of Musical Things

<span style="font-size: 130%;">Abstract</span></br>
This seminar focuses on the new class of augmented musical instruments, the “Smart Instruments”. These are characterized by embedded computational intelligence, bidirectional wireless connectivity, an embedded sound delivery system, and an onboard system for feedback to the player. Smart Instruments bring together separate strands of augmented instrument, networked music and Internet of Things technology, offering direct point-to-point communication between each other and other portable sensor-enabled devices, without need for a central mediator such as a laptop. This technological infrastructure enables an ecosystem of interoperable devices connecting performers as well as performers and audiences, which can support new performer-performer and audience-performer interactions. This has paved the way for the definition of the Internet of Musical Things (IoMUT), where the concept of the Internet of Things is extended to the musical domain. IoMUT refers to the network of computing devices embedded in physical objects (Musical Things) dedicated to the production and/or reception of musical content. Musical Things, such as Smart Instruments or smart devices, are connected by an infrastructure that enables multidirectional communication, both locally and remotely. The IoMUT digital ecosystem gathers interoperable devices and services that connect performers and audiences to support performer-performer and audience-performers interactions, not possible beforehand.
