After the morning poster session, the group got a chance to see the latest research the Music Technology Group including designs of new musical instruments, analysis techniques for non-Western music, and computer-assisted monitoring of a musician's movements during performance.

A group of three students and two academics also had the chance to visit [Hangar](https://hangar.org/en/), an arts centre in Barcelona. Marta Garcia, the Director of the Research Programmes, showed the group around the making facilities, studios, video editing suite, and audio synth studio.
