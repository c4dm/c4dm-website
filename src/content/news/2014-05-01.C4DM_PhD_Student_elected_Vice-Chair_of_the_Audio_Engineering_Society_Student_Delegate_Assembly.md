Congratulations to Brecht De Man, C4DM PhD Student, who was recently elected Vice-Chair of the Audio Engineering Society’s Student Delegate Assembly.

The Student Delegate Assembly (SDA) is led by four AES student members, elected by their peers to represent over 4000 AES student members around the world.

There are two regions, North/Latin America, and Europe/International, and each region is represented by a chair and vice chair. These students essentially commit to a volunteer part-time job in which they assist the Education Committee Chair and Vice Chair to plan, organize, and run student events at conventions, and represent student members to the AES.
