The winners of the QMUL [Engagement and Enterprise Awards 2015](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/publicengagement/prizes/index.html) were announced on 9th November. **Four** C4DM projects were award winners!

* [Dr Josh Reiss](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~josh/) won the *Academic Commercial Enterprise* award for [LandR](https://www.landr.com/), an online service that performs automatic mastering of your music tracks using intelligent signal analysis.



* [Dr Dan Stowell](http://mcld.co.uk/research) and Florence Wilkinson won the *Involve* award for [Warblr](http://warblr.net/), a smartphone app that automatically recognises birds from a simple sound recording. The award recognised the "citizen science" benefit of Warblr, involving the public in collecting audio observations of birds to improve conservation and research.

The project was called "Kam's Romeo & Juliet: Co-creating Interactive Drama Across Cultures", and involved a [large team](https://twitter.com/nickbknickbk/status/663842572159332352) of collaborators working together.

After two successful production runs, TouchKeys is spinning out from QMUL into an independent company.
